# Leetcode: 232. Implement Queue using Stacks.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/31ca59661b88a0d7f3453cf58f053aa9

**Ruby/Go: If pop from A and push in B, B will have reversed A.**

There two stacks: tmp and reversed. Reversed in permanent.

- PUSH. Pop/Push from `reversed` to `tmp`. Push tmp. Pop/Push back from `tmp` to revesed.
- POP. Just pop from `reversed`.
- PEEK. `Reversed` last.
- EMPTY. `Reversed` size.

Let's try.
