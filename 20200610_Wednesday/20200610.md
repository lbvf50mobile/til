Create array left that for each index stores size of consecutive empty places before an index including this index. Create array right that stores the size of consecutive empty places after index including this index.  Than walking through the input array calculate min distance comparing values from left and right. And need to consider corner cases left most seat value get from right array, and right most seat value from left array, because for border position distance before the nearest person counted from opposite side (for left most, need to count from right).
