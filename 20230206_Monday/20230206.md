If `1 == n` then just return current array.
If `n` is bigger then one there are `n` parts where from the elements are taken:

- `0` - start of the first part.
-  `n` - start of the second part.
- `2n` - start of the thirt part.
- `(n-1)*n - star of the n'th part.

And at the answer value there must be `n` parts that cosist of correcponding element from each of the initial n parts.

- `start_position + current_number_of_a_part`. This is a formula to calculate an element for a current part.

The program itself is a nested loop for in iterations inside a lop of n iteration. 

- *Offset:* Outer loop caluclates position in a input part.
- *Start:* Inner loop iteraton all over input part and select elements defindes in outer loop.

Let's try.
