- https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-the-array/discuss/3152518/RubyGo%3A-Half-of-n-times-make-two-pushes.

**Ruby/Go: Half of n times make two pushes.**

From two groups of `n` elements would be `n` groups of two elements. Iterate `n` times and make two push where interval between pushs would be `n`.
