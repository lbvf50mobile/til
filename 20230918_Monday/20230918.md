# Leetcode: 1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/7405b75c5c48f5a41c66e967e00c6790

**Ruby: Map, sort, map, slice, return.**

- Convert rows to sum (number of soldiers in each row).
- Convert element from sum to pair [sum, index].
- Sort by sum and if the sums are equal use indices for sorting.
- Second map from pair to index.
- Slice to k elements from the begining.
- Return.
