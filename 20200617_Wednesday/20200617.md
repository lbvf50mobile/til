## Leetcode: 874. Walking Robot Simulation.

This is an amazing task here need to find maximum distance not final one. So this is great.
Task itself create a map of delta on each step depending on direction, then create map of rotations that resolves what direction will be after rotation. And iterate through commands rotate if need, and make steps in sub loop, finishing it if meat and obstacle on the next step.
