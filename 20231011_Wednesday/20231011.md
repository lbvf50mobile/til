**Ruby: Leetcode's solution. But TLE as usual as with kanwei/algorithms Heap in Ruby.**

It is a translation of the Leetcode's Python [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-flowers-in-full-bloom/solution/) to Ruby. But it leads
to TLE as usual, current AlgoLib is not fast enough.

Ruby code:

  # Based on:

  flowers.sort!
