**Ruby: Backtracking on every call add element and check.**

Use backtracking for every index of the input string. During a backtrack call add a character to a last element of an array of strings. If after this addition last string is a palindrome call backtracing with new empty string in the array of strings. Also call backtraking with the same array withoug new empty string added.

Thus if there is an empty last element previos element is a palindrome. And because there are no empty strings on input,when the backtracking index is out of the inices range and a last string element is empty - it means path contains list of palindromes.
