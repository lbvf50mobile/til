**Ruby: Very simple. Save to array, sort, set pointers.**

Very simple solution. 

- Save the list to the array.
- Sort array by node values.
- Redirect pointers.

Let's try.

Ruby code:

  return nil if head.nil?
  array = []
  tmp = head
  while tmp
    array.push(tmp)
    tmp = tmp.next
  end
  # As a rule against bugs.
  # Take list node - nil pointers.
  array.each{|x| x.next = nil}
  array.sort!{|a,b| a.val <=> b.val}
  (0...(array.size-1)).each do |i|
    array[i].next = array[i+1]
  end
  array[0]
end
```
