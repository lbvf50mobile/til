- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/cefef755e65a314d43213e2b3c4e06fb

**Go: Find three nodes and redirect their next.**

1. Find end of the list2.
2. Find (a-1) element in the list1.
3. Find (b) element in the list1.
4. Redirect (a-1) next to the list2's head, and list2's end to the (b) next.
5. Return head of the list1.
