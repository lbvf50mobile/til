# Leetcode: 1877. Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-maximum-pair-sum-in-array/discuss/4299835/RubyGo%3A-Biggest-with-smallest-is-minimized-maximum.

**Ruby/Go: Biggest with smallest is minimized maximum.**

To get minimized maximum need to move from both directions in a sorted array.
From left and from right, thus a minimum value with a maximum one will give a
minimized maximum; otherwise, there could be two biggest values of the array.

Move from both sides, increase the left pointer, decrease the right one,
select a maximum from pairs, and return it.
