# Leetcode: 443. String Compression.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/1b3f10004c12d630d9ee9fcf73436aef

Two pointers are used. One for read second for write. And also to variables `sym` - current symbol, `cnt` - count of that simbol. When previous simbol is not equal to the current one write data to the array, redefine symbol and reset a counter to one. Also wirte data to the answer array after end of the loop.

The program consists of three parts.

- Initialisation. Read symbol from the 0 intex to a var set counter to 1.
- Loop from 1 till the last index of the array.
- Finalize. Write data to the answer.

Separate function for writing is used.
