- https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/discuss/4002191/Ruby%3A-First-with-hash-second-with-different-speeds.

**Ruby: First with hash, second with different speeds.**

First solution: save all elements in a hash, if element is already in the hash
return true. Return false otherwise. 
Second solution: Pointers move with different speed, when they point on the same
element return true. Return false otherwise.
