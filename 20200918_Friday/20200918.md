Ruby: On insertion divide into tow parts and put an element in the gap.

When insert element `x` at index `i` inside the target array by rules of this task, target divided in to parts elements before index `i`, and elements with index `i` and further. New array target generated by concatenating three pieces first part, `x` element, second part.
