**Ruby: Recursion. Select index, move next, clear selection.**

This solution is pure Backtracking. Recursive function accepts two arguments current index and total sum of prev cals. Also there is a global variable that stores selected elements for current call. Each recursive call mark current index as selected and then "jumps" on rest possible positions by further recursive calls. In other words recursive function contains loop that iterate further indices and call recursive function for them. When function stops working it set it's index as unused. This is the general description. More precisely there are some check to check when to stop recusion and when to save result into the answers array.

Ruby code.
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 40. Combination Sum II.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/
# @param {Integer[]} candidates
# @param {Integer} target
# @return {Integer[][]}
# TLE: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
# 27
def combination_sum2(candidates, target)
    @c,@t = candidates, target
    @answer = []
    @used = Array.new(@c.size,false)
    sum = 0
    (0...@c.size).each{|i| rec(i,sum)}
    @answer.uniq
end
def rec(i,sum)
    new_sum = sum + @c[i]
    return if @t <  new_sum 
    @used[i] = true
    if new_sum == @t
        @answer.push(create_array_from_used())
    else
        (i+1...@c.size).each do |j|
            rec(j,new_sum)
        end
    end
    @used[i] = false
end

def create_array_from_used
    @used.each_with_object([]).with_index{|(is_set,obj),i|
        obj.push(@c[i]) if is_set
    }.sort
end
```
And after some fixes and adintions this leads to the TLE. In this situation need to create version where two additional array cerated sorted and uniq candidates and aamount of mathces for each presented number. Than in recursive function call next nindex after use current index from 0 to available amount of times.

def combination_sum2(candidates, target)
    @n,@a = uniq_numbers_and_amount(candidates)
    @t = target
    @used = Array.new(@n.size,0)
    @answer = []
    i,sum = 0,0
    rec(i,sum)
    return @answer
end
def rec(i,sum)
    return if i >= @n.size
    counter = 0
    while sum < @t && counter <= @a[i]
        rec(i+1, sum)
        sum += @n[i]
        counter += 1
        @used[i] += 1
    end
    if sum == @t && counter <= @a[i]
        @answer.push(array_from_used)
    end
    @used[i] = 0
end

def uniq_numbers_and_amount(input)
    h = input.each_with_object(Hash.new){|x,obj| obj[x] ||= 0; obj[x] += 1}
    numbers = input.sort.uniq
    amount = numbers.map{|x| h[x]}
    [numbers,amount]
end
def array_from_used
    ans = []
    (0...@used.size).each do |i|
        ans += ([@n[i]]*@used[i])
    end
    ans
end
```

P.S. and code with each_with_object([]).with_index did not work because `arr += ([@n[i]]*mul` create new arr as I suppose.
