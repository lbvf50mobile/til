**Ruby: Each element of a string should have a bridge to find itself.**


Short: Each element of a string should have a bridge to find itself. Or starting from root for each charater must be an edge to reach it's node.
 
When standing on a root there is 0 steps. When steps equal size of the word return `true`.
When It is impossible to make a next step return `false`.

In this task there are difference between a word and a prefix so need to add `end` to the word to distinguish word from prefix. Thus before adding string would be transfered to an array and an `end` would be appended. 

Algorithm for adding:   


- On each step append and move, if node exists just move.

Algorithm for checking:

- On each step check possibility to move forward.

Nodes would be a Hashes with `single char` keys and an `end` key to mark the end of a world. Let's try.

      return true

# Your Trie object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Trie.new()
# obj.insert(word)
# param_2 = obj.search(word)
# param_3 = obj.starts_with(prefix)
