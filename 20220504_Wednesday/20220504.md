**Ruby: Counter Hash map, sort by amount, detect pairs by a Hash map.**

- Create a Counter data structure by a Hash Map: index value, value amount of matches.
- Remove duplicates from the array, sort elements by number of matches in the initial array.
- Create Hash map to rember elements that have beed meet.
- In a loop find previous elements substructing current element from k.
- Create condition when previous element is a current one, when is possbile ot get k by pair of cur. elements.
- Reduce Counter value by minimum from the pair, increase the answer by the save value.
- Return answer.

That's all.
