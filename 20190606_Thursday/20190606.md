# Ruby [clamp](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.0/Comparable.html#method-i-clamp) method.

Today I got acuanted with the wonderfull `Ruby` method [clamp](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.0/Comparable.html#method-i-clamp). I was solving a [kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/rgb-to-hex-conversion/ruby) where required to convert three variables into a rgb string: ` rgb(255, 255, 255) # returns FFFFFF`.

Additions complexity was in `Range` of each variable was beyond `(0..255)` from the color values. And needs to add logic to convert values out of the `(0..255)` to `0` and `255` respecively. 

Using [Kernel#sprintf](https://apidock.com/ruby/Kernel/sprintf) and a [Sring#%](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.0/String.html#method-i-25) it's possible to have a neat method for generating string with 3 hex numbers by 2 characters in each of them. Arguments array could be acquired via [map](https://apidock.com/ruby/Array/map)

```ruby
def rgb(*a)
  "%02X%02X%02X" % a.map{|x| 0 >= x ? 0 : (255 <= x ? 255 : x) } 
end
```

it possible to make a shorter solution

```ruby
def rgb(*a)
  "%02X%02X%02X" % a.map{|x| [[0,x].max,255].min } 
end
```

and now time for a [Clamp](https://blog.bigbinary.com/2016/12/13/ruby-2-4-adds-comparable-clamp-method.html) method

```ruby
def rgb(*a)
  "%02X%02X%02X" % a.map{|x| x.clamp(0,255) } 
end
```
