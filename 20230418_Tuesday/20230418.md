# Leetcode: 1768. Merge Strings Alternately.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/discuss/3432169/RubyGo%3A-Two-pointers-three-loops.

**Ruby/Go: Two pointers, three loops.**

First loop while there at leas one element in both strings. Second and third loops append elements from an unfinised string. A second or third loops would **not** start if a string is finished because of loop conditions.
