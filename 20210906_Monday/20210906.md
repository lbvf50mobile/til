**Ruby: Create durations array. Find max, zip, select, sort, last, first.**

Going to create array duration and fill it, 0 index element would be pre defiend as release time, futher elements wold be found as `release_time[i] - release_time[i-1]`. During this loop max duration would be found. Next zip durations with keys, select with maximum values, sort by key, return last key. That's it.
