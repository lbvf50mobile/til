# Leetcode: 3264. Final Array State After K Multiplication Operations I

**Go: Min Heap of Pairs.**

- https://leetcode.com/problems/final-array-state-after-k-multiplication-operations-i/discuss/6153490/Go%3A-Min-Heap-of-Pairs.

A min-heap of pairs is created, where each pair consists of an index and a
value from the `input` array nums. During the loop of `k` iterations, a pair
is popped, its value is changed, and it is pushed back into the heap. After
the loop, this solution iterates over the underlying slice of pairs in the
min-heap and saves the values into `nums` using the indices stored in the
first element of each pair.
