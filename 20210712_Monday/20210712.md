**Ruby: Convert str to array appear orders, compare.**

Idea of this solution is to substitute characters in a string by numbers, where each churacter substituted by order of occurence in a strig. For example aabc => 1 1 2 3. And string would be an array.

def is_isomorphic(s, t)
  str2arr(s) == str2arr(t)
end

def str2arr(s)
  counter = 0
  order = s.chars.each_with_object(Hash.new){|el,obj| 
    if !obj[el]
      obj[el] = counter
      counter += 1
    end
  }
  s.chars.map{|x| order[x]}
end
```
