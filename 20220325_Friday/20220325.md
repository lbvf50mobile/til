**Ruby: All go to A, calculate profit go to B, sort, select bigger half.**

1. Calculate prize to send all folks to the `A`.
2. Calculate profit if folk `i` will got to the `B`. It is `a price` - `b price` if `a price` bigger it is a profit to got to the `B`.
3. From total price `n go to A` substract most profitable half of B profit.

What is `most profitable half of B profit`?

Is is a sum of half of the descending sorted array from the step number two.

Let's try.

P.S. Initially this code based on [the solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-city-scheduling/discuss/761411/python3-solution-that-beats-97-with-explanation).
