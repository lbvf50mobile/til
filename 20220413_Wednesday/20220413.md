# Leetcode: 59. Spiral Matrix II.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/2657f54ff12df0d9ec792e69cd6a9410
 
0 - move right.
1 - move down.
2 - move left.
3 - move top.

Next direction may be calculated like `(direction+1)%4`. 
Also need to fill matrix with 0, and change direction if out of border or next step is filled.  
If chante direction and next element is filled leave the loop.


Let's try.
