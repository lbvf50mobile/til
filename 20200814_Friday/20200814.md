First histogram of all domino matches created, and in histogram added domino rotated such way that minimal value is at the left part.
Then iterate over all matches and calculate how many pairs could be created from this number. 

Number of pairs that could be created from a number x, equal sum of elements from 1 to x-1. This is a sum of elements of an arithmetic progression `S = (a0 + aN)*n/2` and if `n = x-1` it will be `(1+n)*n/2`.

## Leetcode: 409. Longest Palindrome.

It's a great task for recall.

Sum that is answer comprises three parts:
1. Sum of all even matches.
2. Greatest odd match.
3. Sum of a rest of odd matches except the greatest one minus it's amount. It could be described as  sum rest odd matches transformed to even by one deduction.  And this one subtracting could be represented as deduction of array size.

def longest_palindrome(s)
    arr = s.chars.each_with_object(Hash.new()){|x,obj| obj[x] ||= 0; obj[x] += 1}.values
    even_sum = arr.select(&:even?).sum
    odd = arr.select(&:odd?).sort{|x| -x}
    max_odd = odd.pop() || 0
    odd_changed_sum =  odd.sum - odd.size
    even_sum + max_odd + odd_changed_sum
end
```

Seven month ago I solved this task, that time I created trigger that stores parity of odd values. Each odd value was decreased by one.  And depending of triggers  state one was added to  a sum of even and changed odd values.

def longest_palindrome(s)
    hist = s.chars.each_with_object({}){|x,obj| obj[x] ||= 0; obj[x] += 1}
    odd_flag = false
    sum = hist.values.sum{ |x| 
        odd_flag = true if odd_flag || x.odd?
        x.odd? ? x - 1 : x
        }
    odd_flag ? sum + 1 : sum
end
