- https://leetcode.com/problems/destination-city/discuss/4409248/Go%3A-Map-of-struct's-pointeres.

**Go: Map of struct's pointers.**

- Create a city struct with `in` and `out` fields.
- Iterate over an input and fill the map where a key is city, a value is the
  struct.
- Mark `in` and `out` fields during an interation.
- Loop over the map and found an element where `out` is false, and return it.
