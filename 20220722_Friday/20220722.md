**Ruby: Create two linked list, connect them at the end.**


Create two linked lists.
- One for elements that less than x.
- One for elements that bigger or equal than x.
- Connect tial of first one to the head of last one. Return head of first one.

Solution is a loop with two levels if/else conditions. First level to check which list to extend, internal conditions to check wether set a head or append a new element.

Let's try.
