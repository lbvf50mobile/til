- https://leetcode.com/problems/making-a-large-island/discuss/1378488/Ruby%3A-Zeros-as-bridges-between-explored-islands.
 
**Ruby: Zeros as bridges between explored islands.**

Idea is to explore all islands and then use a zero as a breadge that connect up to four already existed islands.

1. Fill each island cells by uniq id for this island by BFS or DFS.
2. Crate hash to store island id and it's size.
3. Save maximum size of a island.
4. Iterate over zeros, treat them like bridges that connect islands.
5. Calculate total area of new island after creating new breadge. Save maximum.

# Leetcode: 1. Two Sum.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/discuss/1378562/Ruby%3A-Use-Hash-where-key-is-value-and-a-value-is-an-index.

**Ruby: Use Hash where key is value, and a value is an index.**

Some basic math:

`target = a[i] + a[j]`
`target - a[j] = a[i]`

And having a hash where values of the array are keys, we gould get `i` by it value `h[a[i]] == i` and having `a[i] = target - a[j]` it is possible to find an `i` index by `h[target-a[j]] == i`. Moving along the array add data to the hash, and check is there a `target - a[j]` in the hash keys. One pass over the input array to find and answer.

    prev_value = target - el
    return [h[prev_value],j] if h[prev_value]
    h[el] = j # Value as a key, key as index.
  end
  raise "Cannot find an answer in this task."
