**Ruby: Zeros as bridges between explored islands.**

Idea is to explore all islands and then use a zero as a breadge that connect up to four already existed islands.

1. Fill each island cells by uniq id for this island by BFS or DFS.
2. Crate hash to store island id and it's size.
3. Save maximum size of a island.
4. Iterate over zeros, treat them like bridges that connect islands.
5. Calculate total area of new island after creating new breadge. Save maximum.
