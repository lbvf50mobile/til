Created histogram to get amount of match of each characters in stones string in liner time. Then used sum method on jewels to sum amount of match each type of jewel in a stones. Here need to be careful about situations when there is not such jewel in current stones array.

def num_jewels_in_stones(j, s)
    h = s.chars.each_with_object(Hash.new){|value,object| 
            object[value] ||= 0;
            object[value] += 1;
    }
    j.chars.sum{|x| h[x] || 0}
