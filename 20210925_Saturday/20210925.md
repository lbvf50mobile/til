# Leetcode: 1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination.

**Ruby: BFS with number of steps.**

The problem solved with BFS, where each unit in the queue also has an nuber of steps to reach it.

Need to have:

- `unused` matrix to check which cells already used.
- Bonunds and destination point.
- Delta array possible steps.

If bottom-right corner is unreachable return -1. The problem is solved by two loops.

- Main loop iterates over queue.
- Second loop iterates over possibe moves.

Ruby code:
