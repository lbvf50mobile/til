**Ruby: BFS with number of obstacles overcomed.**

Solution based on: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/discuss/451832/Python-Short-BFS-Solution it is an amazing code, here in BFS next step based not on simple visited/univisited condition but on number of obstacles overcomed at the last visit by the algorithm.  

I really appreciate https://leetcode.com/douzigege/ for this solution.
