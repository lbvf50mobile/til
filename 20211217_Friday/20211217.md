**Ruby: Pull DP. Square by three points.**

1. It is definitely a DP problem.
2. Each cell stores the side length of the maximum square with a `right-bottom` corner at this point.
3. Work only with cells initially filled by 1.
4. New value in the cell is a minimum from left, top, and top-left neighbors plus one.
5. Add one more row and column of zeros to make arithmetic simpler.
 
Let's try. 

**Note:** Needs to return an area of the maximum square. Need to square the maximum side length.
