**Ruby: Pull DP. Square by three points.**

1. It is definately DP problem.
2. Each cell stores side lenght of maximum square with `right-bottom` corner in this point.
3. Work only with cells initally filled by 1.
4. New value in cell is a minimum from left, top and top-left neigbours plus one.
5. Add one more row and collumn of zeroz to make arithmetic simpler.
 
Let's try. 

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 221. Maximal Square.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/
# @param {Character[][]} matrix
# @return {Integer}
def maximal_square(matrix)
    
end
```
