BASH code. My first solution.
```Bash
# Leetcode: 194. Transpose File.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/transpose-file/
# Read from the file file.txt and print its transposed content to stdout.
# Runtime: 1292 ms, faster than 5.15% of Bash online submissions for Transpose File.
# Memory Usage: 3.5 MB, less than 91.28% of Bash online submissions for Transpose File.
# Thanks God!
input="file.txt"
declare -A matrix
while read -r line
do
	matrix["${#matrix[@]}"]=$line
done < "$input"

rows="${#matrix[@]}"
line=(${matrix[0]})
cols="${#line[@]}"

for ((j=0; j<cols; j++)) do
	tmp=""
	for ((i=0; i<rows; i++)) do
		line=(${matrix[$i]})
		tmp="$tmp ${line[$j]}"
	done
	echo $tmp
done
```
BASH Code for exploration, fastest solution at the Leetcode.
```Bash
# Read from the file file.txt and print its transposed content to stdout.
col=$(($(head -n1 file.txt | grep -o " " | wc -l)+1))
 
for (( k=1; k<=$col; k++ ))
do
  cut -d " " -f"$k" file.txt | paste -d " " -s
done
```
