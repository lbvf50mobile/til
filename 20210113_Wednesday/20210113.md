Some simple task because I had no time to solve big one:
```Python
def score_to_tally(score):
    answer = ""
    if score >= 5:
        answer += "e <br>" * (score//5)
        score -= 5*(score//5)
    if score > 0:
        answer += chr(ord('a') + score - 1)
    return answer
```

```Ruby
def score_to_tally(score)
  "e <br>"*(score/5) + ['',?a,?b,?c,?d][score%5]
end
```

```JavaScript
var scoreToTally = (x, a =(new Array(parseInt(x/5)).fill("e <br>"))) => {
  a.push(["","a","b","c","d"][x%5]);
  return a.join("");
}
```
