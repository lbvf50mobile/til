Create histogram in a hash: keys are elements of the array, values number of matches of each element. Change num array in place by two loops, external loop iterate over indices, internal loop iterate over histogram keys, on each key that less then current array element increase counter by the key value. Save loop value at the current index of external array.

    hist = nums.each_with_object(Hash.new){|x,obj| obj[x] ||= 0; obj[x]+=1;}
    (0...nums.size).each do |i|
        value = nums[i]
        counter = 0
        hist.keys.each do |key|
            counter += hist[key] if value > key

        nums[i] = counter

P.S. This task could be [solved as a prefix sum array](https://leetcode.com/problems/how-many-numbers-are-smaller-than-the-current-number/discuss/841228/Java-best-time-O(n)-counting-each-occurrence) because there are only 101 possible element value to save in an input array. It's possible to calculate on one  pass over a histogram  how may element are less then current one, as a sum of previous values.
