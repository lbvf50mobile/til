**Ruby: Straightforward, an array with n+1 elements.**

Create a boolean array with `n+1` elements to have indices in the range from `1` till `n`. Iterate over input array marking occurred numbers in the array by index setting `true` value. Iterate over the array a second time and push all indices with `falsy` values into the answer array.
