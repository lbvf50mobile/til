**Ruby: Passing min and max as an argument in DFS calls.**

Maximum differenct is difference between minimum and maximum. Each child stay with ancestor in one stack of recursive calls. To solve this problem need to pas minimum and maximum node value during DFS in the functions arguments. And save maximum differnce in some "golbal" variable. In case of Ruby it vould be an instance variable. 

Thank you for reading. And good luck in coding.
