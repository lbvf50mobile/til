**Go: Save pointers in a slice.**

1. Create a slice of size 31 because of the constraints and one for the end's
   nil.
2. Fill that slice in a loop, also use an `i` variable as the amount of
   elements.
3. If it is needed to delete a head, return the second element in the slice,
   index `1`.
4. Otherwise, use point `Next` of element before one for removing to the index
   right after the one for removing.
5. Return the head.
