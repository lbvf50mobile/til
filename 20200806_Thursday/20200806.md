To make working with addresses more convenient transfer 1-based indexes to 0-based, but deduction 1 from each number in path's paris. Then create adjacency list, and array where for each garden index stored indexes of gardens connected by a roads.

Now it's time to iterate over all array indexes and select what type of flowers will be planted in garden. In particular garden must be planted flowers that does not planted in connected gardens.

How to achieve such condition?

Need to create answer array filled with zeros - this mean no flowers planted in all. And create two loops: external one to iterate through gardens, and internal one to iterate through adjacency gardens. And in internal loop select a color (flower type) for a current garden that is not selected by any of adjacent neighbors.

To make selection faster bit mask are used, for every flower type there is a bit mask that going to set appropriate bit for zero by a bitwise operation. And before the initial loop created number that represent set of ones in binary representation, during iteration over a neighbors appropriate bits set to zero if such color is used by a neighbor garden. Number of color mapped to a bit with the same number counting from right.

After the internal loop, color of current garden will be equal to the number of a first bit set to one.
