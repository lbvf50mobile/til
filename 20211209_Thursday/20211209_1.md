**Ruby: Push DP, ways to fill a column.**


[About pull/push DP.](https://youtu.be/YBSt1jYwVfU)    

There are four ways two cells column could be filled: empty, top cell, bottom cell, both cells.

From each state where a number of transactions to full fill the current column and move to the next one. In this task from the current state of a column would fill the states of the next column just adding its value to them.

And do not forget about modulo operation before the answer.
