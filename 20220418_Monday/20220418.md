**Ruby: Inorder with counter.**

Implement inorder iterative solution, on every pop operation compare counter with `k`.

For inorder solution required. 
- Stack. Where pointers would be stored.
- General loop that comprise two sub loops. New iteration starts on every step right.
- Internal loop that moves left as far as possible.
- Second internal loop, that pops elements from the stack, till the first right pointer.
- In the second internal loop `counter` variable compares with `k`.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
