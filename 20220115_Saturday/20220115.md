**Ruby: Adjacency List, BFS by layers, clear List element.**

- Create a weird Adjacency List, where are values of the array are nodes as well. For each value add a set of indices.
- Implement BFS by layers. Where on each iteration new array for a layer is created.
- And a most important thing! After adding to layer all elements from the value of a weird Adjacency list, clear it! This is the only way to escape from LTS.

Based on [described problem solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-iv/solution/). Really appreciate it.
