Task solved by two consecutive loops. First loop started from second element of the array and iterates until array stop strictly increase. Second loop starts from the penultimate (one before end) element of the array and moves backwards  until array stop decreasing. Eventually first loop variable stands on element after stop increasing, and second loop variable stands on the element before decreasing starts, if move first variable on step back and second variable on step forward they must point on the same element in a valid mountain array.
