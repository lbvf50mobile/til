**Ruby: Sort, move pointers from the both sides.**


Code based on the Leetcode's solution.

1. Neet to sort tokens ascending.
2. Set `ans` and `pnts`, ans would be a bigest value of `pnts`.
3. Start main loop while low pointer is less or equal to hight pointer and we could by `pnts` or have `pnts` for a power.
4. In the main loop. Set sub loop for buying `pnts` from the `low pointer` until it is possible.
5. In the main loop. Set `ans` from `ans` and `point`.
6. In the main loop. Check is it possible to exchange one form `pnts` for power.
7. Return ans.

Let's try.

  ans
