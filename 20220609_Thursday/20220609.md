**Ruby: Hash map where index is an element value and array_index is a value.**

Just a simple Algebra: `a + b = target; a = target - b`.  
Create a Hash map with the values as the indices, indices as values. 
If there are such index equal `target - current_value` return it. 
Otherwise save new value as an index.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
