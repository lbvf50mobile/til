**Ruby: Two solution. Loop and binary representation check.**

Very straightforward solution. Just divide by four untill result is `1`. And check on every step by a modulo operation.

Let's try. 

Ruby code(1):
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 342. Power of Four.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-four/
# = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
# Accetped.
# Thanks God, Jesus Christ!
# = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
# Runtime: 69 ms, faster than 100.00% of Ruby online submissions for Power of Four.
# Memory Usage: 211.2 MB, less than 14.29% of Ruby online submissions for Power of Four.
# @param {Integer} n
# @return {Boolean}
def is_power_of_four(n)
  while n > 1
    return false if 0 != n%4
    n /= 4
  end
  1 == n
end
```

Second approach number of zeros in the right part must be even. Wait! The binary representation must be `1 and even number of zeros`. 

Let's try.

P.S. Need to check for negative values.
P.P.S. Also when defining the regex need to set begining and end of the string to have `start 1 even number of zeros end` format.

Ruby code(2):
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 342. Power of Four.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-four/
# = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
# Accetped.
# Thanks God, Jesus Christ!
# = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
# Runtime: 96 ms, faster than 90.48% of Ruby online submissions for Power of Four.
# Memory Usage: 211.1 MB, less than 38.10% of Ruby online submissions for Power of Four.
# @param {Integer} n
# @return {Boolean}
def is_power_of_four(n)
  return true if 1 == n
  return false if n < 1
  ans = true
  str = n.to_s(2)
  # Errors were here need to set bouns of the string.
  if /^10+$/ === str
    ans = str.size.odd? # 1 + even number of zeros.
  else
    ans = false
  end
  return ans
end
```
