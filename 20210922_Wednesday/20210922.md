**Ruby: Backtraking with a char counter.**

Idea behind this solution is to check all combinations of words and find longest. Global variable `max` to store the longest string, an array that stores counter for every character by it's index in the alphabet. And a recurstion that visits next elements of the array and checks do adding current word to a counter would create some duplicates. The recursive functin would takes as an aruguments: Index in words array, counter_array, length of previous concatineted word. Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters.

# https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/september-leetcoding-challenge-2021/639/week-4-september-22nd-september-28th/3984/
# @param {String[]} arr
# @return {Integer}
def max_length(arr)
    
end
```
