**Ruby: Recursive remove descendant that has no 1.**

Return treu if current value is 1 or one of the descendands returns true. And also need to unconnect the "0" descendands. To do than create a variable for return, and set it to true if there are ones, also in `if` remove `0` descendands in a recursive module. Also if root return `0` return `nil` from the "main" method.
