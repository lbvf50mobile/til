# Leetcode: 91. Decode Ways.

**Ruby/Go: Push DP on string + 1 size dp array.**

1. Only one way to reach dp[0].
2. dp size is string size + 1, because need to reach end of the string position.
3. If current element is `0` in the loop just skip.
4. If there is more the one elemen of the string ahead check do the upfornt pair is between 10 and 26, and push value to i+2.
5. Put value to i+1 any way.

Let's try.
