**Go: Skip empty. Number of beams is prev times curr.**

To solve this problem need three variables and a nested loop. One variable for
an answer, one for the amount of devices in the previous row, one for amount
of the current row. Outer loop iterates over rows, inner loop calculates the
amount of devices into the `curr` variable. If `curr` variable is not zero,
number of beams between rows is previous amount multiplied by current one.
