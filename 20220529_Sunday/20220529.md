**Ruby: Intersection of used chars must be zero.**

Create bit mask that shows what chars are used in a strigs. Bit and of such mask must be zero to check these strings for multiplation. Sort strings by lengths descending.

Use two pointers.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby

def max_product(words)
  x = words.map{|w| [w,w.size,bit_mask(w)]}
  # Sort by lenght descending.
  x = x.sort_by{|el| -el[1]}
  max = 0
  (0...words.size-1).each do |i|
    (i+1...words.size).each do |j|
      if 0 == (x[i][2] & x[j][2])
        ans = x[i][1]*x[j][1]
        max = ans if ans > max
      end
    end
  end
  max
end

def bit_mask(w)
  map = 0
  w.chars.each do |c|
    map |= (1 << (c.ord - ?a.ord))
  end
  map
end
