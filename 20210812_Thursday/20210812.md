**Ruby: Fill Hash by key based on symbol matches.**

Convert each string into sorted sring and use that as a key to access the subarray for grouping anagrams. But wait! Strings are very long up to `10**4`, need find key that is a lot shourter. Only 26 sybmols could be used in a string, so it is possible to created array of 26 elements, where each element stores amount of corresponding symbol, charcter index of the Latin (English) alphabet. This array could be maped into string of 51 because of delimiters and this strign used as a key. And just goup all stirng from an input array by this kind of key.
