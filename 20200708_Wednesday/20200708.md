When meet "I" symbol in the answer array inserted minimum possible value of the rest ones, because next one must be greater. When meet "D" symbol in the answer array inserted maximum possible value from the rest of values, because next value need to be less then current. Minimum value could be achieved by shift operation on a range, Maximum value could be acquired by pop operation on a range.
