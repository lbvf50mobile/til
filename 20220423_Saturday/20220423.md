**Ruby: Joke. Tiny equal to long.**

What if just save url by id?
But what if `tiny_url == long_url`, because there are no algorithm?

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby

# Runtime: 107 ms, faster than 76.47% of Ruby online submissions for Encode and Decode TinyURL.
# Memory Usage: 210.9 MB, less than 35.29% of Ruby online submissions for Encode and Decode TinyURL.
#
# Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
#
# @param {string} longUrl
# @return {string}
def encode(longUrl)
  return longUrl
  @a ||= {}
  @b ||= {}
  @counter ||= 0
  if @a[longUrl]
    return
  else
    @counter += 1
    @a[longUrl] = @counter
    @b[@counter] = longUrl
  end
  "http://"
    
end

# Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
#
# @param {string} shortUrl
# @return {string}
def decode(shortUrl)
  return shortUrl
end


# Your functions will be called as such:
# decode(encode(url))
```
