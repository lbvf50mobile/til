**Ruby: Filling hash, seeking for halved and doubled values.**

Create empty hash, and during loop over elements first search for doubled element in keys of the hahs, then search for halved value, if one this values stored as a key return true. Add current value as a key to the hash. Return false if loop fished and there was no return. Need to spend some time working with integer and float formats of keys and values during division, need to check that halved value has no fractional part.
