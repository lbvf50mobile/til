# Leetcode: 38. Count and Say.

**Ruby/Go: Recursive call, loop, counter, return.**

First need to implement a recursive call from `n-1`. Then interate over an answer string from the recursive call and iterate over it with a counter, and generate a new string and return it.

Ruby code:
```Ruby

def count_and_say(n)
  return "1" if 1 == n
  return "11" if 2 == n
  return "21" if 3 == n
  return "1211" if 4 == n
  prev = count_and_say(n-1)
  answer = ""
  counter = 1
  (1...prev.size).each do |i|
    if prev[i-1] == prev[i]
      counter += 1
    else
      answer += counter.to_s + prev[i-1]
      counter = 1
    end
  end
  answer += counter.to_s + prev[-1]
  return answer
end
```

Go code:
```Go

  if 1 == n { return "1"}
  if 2 == n { return "11"}
  if 3 == n { return "21"}
  if 4 == n { return "1211"}
  prev := countAndSay(n - 1)
  answer := ""
  counter := 1
  for i := 1; i < len(prev); i += 1 {
    if prev[i-1] == prev[i] {
      counter += 1
    } else {
      answer += strconv.Itoa(counter) + string(prev[i-1])
      counter = 1
    }
  }
  answer += strconv.Itoa(counter) + string(prev[len(prev)-1])
  return answer
}
```
