Two strings are special equivalent if their histograms for even indexed chars and odd indexed chars are equal. Because there are only 26 different chars in this task, the both histograms could be represented as array of 52 elements. First map array of strings to array of histograms. Than create array name used to mark words that already in groups, and compare all words with each other by two loops external and internal one. External one iterates over all indexes, and internal start iteration from index after external one. Skip indexes already in groups for both arrays. When pointing on new index in external array if it is not used new group is started, during internal loop mark all words in this group as used. So on next iteration of external loop indices of this group will be skipped.
