- https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-morse-code-words/discuss/655442/Ruby-solution.

Save in array morse codes where index `0` stores `a`. Than wrote a lambda that converts alphabetical string to a morse code. Then map all words to morse code, mare array uniq, return the size of the array.

Comment by @limonadev.

Just a bit of help:   

- Not all coloring vertex algorithms work here. I tested (using Dart) the greedy algorithm and the Welsh-Powell algorithm and both failed on some tests (if you dont sort by degree for the Weish-Powell, it will fail only at test 14).
- The backtracking colouring algorithm (Described here https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/m-coloring-problem-backtracking-5/) works on all tests (again, using Dart)

My code to test connected components.  
Ruby code:  
```Ruby
# https://app.codesignal.com/interview-practice/task/bdatSZvuKFyjJ8eYw
# dose not woks.
def feedingTime(classes)
    # Create adjacency list.
    @list = {}
    classes.each_with_index do |v,i|
        @list[i] = []
        classes.each_with_index do |v1,j|
            if i != j
                @list[i].push(j) if ! (v&v1).empty?
            end
        end
    end
    # visited
    @visited = {}
    components = []
    # Iterate over all elements and calculate how many vertexes in each
    (0...classes.size).each do |i|
        if @visited[i].nil?
            @visited[i] = true
            components.push(dfs(i));
        end
    end
    p components
    3
end
def dfs(i)
    ans = 1
    @list[i].each do |j|
        if @visited[j].nil?
            @visited[j] = true
            ans += dfs(j)
        end
    end
    ans
end
```
