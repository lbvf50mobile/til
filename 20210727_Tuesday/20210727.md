**Ruby: Select direction to move in the folded loop.**

Use brute force iterate all possible pairs and find minimum delta and sum attached to this delta. And that brings to Time Limit Exceed.   

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 16. 3Sum Closest.
# https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge-2021/611/week-4-july-22nd-july-28th/3828/
# And that brings to TLE.
# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @param {Integer} target
# @return {Integer}
def three_sum_closest(nums, target)
  sum = nums[0...3].sum
  min = (target-sum).abs
  (0...nums.size-2).each do |i|
    (i+1...nums.size-1).each do |j|
      (j+1...nums.size).each do |k|
        if min > (target-nums[i]-nums[j]-nums[k]).abs
          min = (target-nums[i]-nums[j]-nums[k]).abs
          sum = nums[i]+nums[j]+nums[k] 
        end
      end
    end
  end
  return sum
end
```

Brute force does not work, `O(n**3)` is to heavy need to have someting `O(n**2)`. For that need to sort array and deifne the direction to move in the second foded loop. If a sum greater then target move pointer towards small values and toward bigger values otherwice.

def three_sum_closest(nums, target)
  diff = nil
  n = nums.sort
  (0...n.size-2).each do |i|
    j,k = i+1, n.size-1
    while j < k
      sum = n[i] + n[j] + n[k]
      if diff.nil? || (target-sum).abs < diff.abs
        diff = target-sum
      elsif sum < target
        j += 1
      else
        k -= 1
      end
    end
      break if 0 == diff
  end
    target - diff
end
```
