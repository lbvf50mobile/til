**Ruby: Start build new seq, if there is no previous element.**

The soulution is based on Set datastructure. 

- First an input array converted to set.
- Iterate over all set elements.
- If there is no previous element for the current loop variable, start build new sequence in a loop.
- It folded loop for building new seq. Check on each iteratin that next element exits in the set.
- Save maximum lenght of sequence in the asnwer variable.

Based on the [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/solution/).
