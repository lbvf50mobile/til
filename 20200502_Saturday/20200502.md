Define left and and right borders as first and last index of the array. In the loop while left border is strictly less than right one calculate middle. Middle is calculated by this formula `mid = left + (right - left)/2 = left + right/2 - left/2 = left/2 + right/2 = (left+right)/2`. If element under middle is target return middle. Otherwise if target is less then middle element right pointer now point on `middle-1`, if greater left pointer points on `middle + 1`. If solution is not find in loop, and left become equal to right, check may be element under `left` is equal to target, if not return `-1`.

=end
# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @param {Integer} target
# @return {Integer}
def search(nums, target)
    return -1 if nums.empty?
    lo = 0
    hi = nums.size - 1
    while lo < hi
        mid = (lo+hi)/2
        return mid if target == nums[mid]
        if target < nums[mid]
            hi = mid-1
        else
            lo = mid + 1
        end
    end
    nums[hi] == target ? hi : -1
    
end
```

Also the code could be simplified and optimized by using less or equal in loop condition. Also the code could be simplified and optimized by using less or equal in loop condition. Always compare `target` with `nums[mid]`.
