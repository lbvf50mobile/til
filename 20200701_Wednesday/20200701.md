Even elements of the array zip with odd elements of the array. In the new array will be list of pairs where even element placed on even index, and odd element on odd one. Next flatten array of pairs and get the answer.

def sort_array_by_parity_ii(a)
    a.select{|x| x.even?}.zip(a.select{|x| x.odd?}).flatten
end
```

##### In place solution.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity-ii/discuss/714803/Ruby.-O(n)-change-array-in-place-by-swapping-elements-with-incorrect-parity.

Create two pointers one for odd indices second for even indies. In main loop by nested loops set each pointers for left most elements that have incorrect parity and swap them. In each iteration of main loop find incorrect parity and swap. Array will be changed in place. Thanks @quantumlexa for his example of nested loops code in Leetcode: 917 Reverse only letters.
