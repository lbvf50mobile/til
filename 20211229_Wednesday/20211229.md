**Ruby: BFS, FIFO, shift and point to the same layer.**

Create BFS. When shifting an element from the queue, point it to the index 0 of the queue (in case of the same level of both elements). BFS queue contains not only a pointer but a level number as well. In this case, two queues are used to avoid the initialization of a new pair on every step.

Let's try.

  while ! q.empty?
    element = q.shift
    level = ql.shift

    if (!q.empty?) && ql.first == level
      element.next = q.first
    end
    if element.left
      q.push(element.left)
      ql.push(level+1)
