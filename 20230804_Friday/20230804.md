**Ruby: DP. Subproblem addres is index.**

Idea to cut dictionary words from the input string till the end. If end is
reached then true.

To reduce time conusmption save results for ieach index. Save dicitionary's
words in the arrays in the Hash by a first letter. If current input letter
exists as a Hask key test all words from the appropriate array and call next
recursion call for index plus a word's length.
