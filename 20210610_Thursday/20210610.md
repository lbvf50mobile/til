**Ruby: Rotate means transpose an reverse each row.**

Two more methods added one to compare two matrix by flatten them and then compare flat arrays by Ruby features. And method for rotating, that is transpose and map where reverse each row. In the main method simple comaration firist, then 3 rotates and compare. If after rotations matrixes would not fit return false, but if there were similar matrixes exit from the method with true.
