- https://leetcode.com/problems/score-of-parentheses/discuss/1858464/Ruby%3A-Open-greater-push-new-level.-Close-greater-pop-and-add.
 
**Ruby: Open -> push new level. Close -> pop and add.**

On open bracket push a new `level` in the stack.  
On close bracket pop `current level` and add to the previos level.  
If current level's value is 0 add 1, if more than zero multiply it's value by two.  

Let's try.  

Ruby code:
```Ruby
