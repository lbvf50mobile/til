**Ruby: Until next equal nil.**

Need to store: previous node to revese pointer on it, current to take next, and next to move forward.   
If next equal to zero no way to move forward.

What we need to do:

1. Save next.
2. Point current.next to previous.
3. Make current next.

At this point it is obvios when next is `nil`, no need to make current next, need to exit the method. So method would define several variables and a loop.  

Even in loop could be a branch. If next is `nil` just redirect and return. If not save next, redirect, set new previous and new current.

Ok. Let's try to code this.

Ruby code:

  return head if head.nil?
  prev, curr = nil, head
  while curr
    if curr.next.nil? # no way to move forward.
      curr.next = prev
      return curr # time to return.
    else
      tmp = curr.next # it is possible to move forward.
      curr.next = prev
      prev = curr
      curr = tmp # make step foward, next become current.
    end
  end
  raise "This line could not be reached, error in the algorithm or in the input."
end
```
