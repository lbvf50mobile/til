**Ruby/Go: Hash map, sort, slice and map.**

1. Create a counter data type based on hash map.
2. Convert hash map to an array of pairs.
3. Sort this array by frequece, if frequence is the same sort by lexicographical order.
4. Slice array from 0 inclusive till k exclusive.
5. Return.

Let's try.

- UPD 1. Need to sort descending by frequence and ascending by lexicographical order.
- UPD 2. Need to convert an answer slice from array of pairs to array of strings.
