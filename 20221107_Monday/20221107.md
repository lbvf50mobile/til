# Leetcode: 1323. Maximum 69 Number.

**Ruby/Go: Change left most six to nine.**

Find left most six and subsitute it by nine. Convert to string in the Ruby solution. Use modulo operation and division in the Go solution to detect index of a six in [Positional notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation).
