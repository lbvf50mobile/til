**Ruby/Go: Move along sorted queries and move pointer over prefix sum array.**

Time: O(Nlog(N) + Mlog(M)); Memory: O(N + M);

1. Sort nums.
2. Create prefix sum array over sorted nums.
3. Sort queires but preserv old inidices to save in answer.
4. Interate over queries.
5. Move pointer over prefix array during every iteration of an outer loop. Do not reset pointer of prefix sum array. Because quieries will grow.

Because loop for prefix array stops when poiter is moved away from valid index (sum become beger, or array ended) need to reduce it. But do not allow this pointer to be less then zero by condtion (it would be more clear in the solutions).
