**Ruby: BFS returns two values.**

Create an visited matres. Iterate over all elements of an input matrix, run BFS
on unvisted ones. During BFS check do it possible to reach elements over and
edge of an input matrix - it is a first return value, second return value is a
number of cells during curren BFS run. If it is not possible to jump over an
edge add the second value to the return answer.
