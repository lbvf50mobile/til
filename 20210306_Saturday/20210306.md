**Ruby: Recursive method with two arguments.**

Two Trees are flip equivalent if each node in first tree has pair with the same value, same amount of children, same values for children, and same rule applied for each child. And this task could be solved by recursion that takes two pointers.      

- Both pointers nil return true.
- if there is nil and not nil - return false.
- if both not nil and have different values return false.
- if both not nil and have same values here start **most interesting case**.

**Most interesting case**. 

In most interesting case two ways or sub trees equal without flip  or they equal with fip.  
If without flip: two calls (left,left) and (right,right) must return true.  
If with flip: (left,right) and (right,left) must return true.
