My conception is breaking points `i` where  `a[i-1] >= a[i] <= a[i+1]`. Between breaking points (exclisive) need to have min and max. Value of  min will be 2, because 1 is used by breaking boint,  value of max will be `max-min + 2` so if `min == 10` and `max == 15` the value of max wold be `15-10+2 = 17`.  And value of `ans[i] = a[i]-min+2`.

I need left breaking  point, max and min, to start moving left and fill the answers.  

Looks like this concept would not work because of fall after plato. So need to count a height of breaking point. And good Idea is to add minimums to begining and and of the array thus there no need to add someting additonal cases to the algorithm. And a begining already breaking points.



After several tests I have a new Idea. So first moving right and every cell of array that in the growing sequence increse from 1 till end of the section. Then rotate an ararray and repeat. So what is a growing sequence  `(a[i] > a[i-1]) || (a[i] < a[i+1])`. Next question how to add numbers. if `a[i] > a[i-1]` then take value from previous and if `(a[i] < a[i+1]) then it is just a begining and set 1.
