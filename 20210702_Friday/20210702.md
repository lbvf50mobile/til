My conception is breaking points `i` where  `a[i-1] >= a[i] <= a[i+1]`. Between breaking points (exclisive) need to have min and max. Value of  min will be 2, because 1 is used by breaking boint,  value of max will be `max-min + 2` so if `min == 10` and `max == 15` the value of max wold be `15-10+2 = 17`.  And value of `ans[i] = a[i]-min+2`.

I need left breaking  point, max and min, to start moving left and fill the answers.
