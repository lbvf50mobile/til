My conception is breaking points `i` where  `a[i-1] >= a[i] <= a[i+1]`. Between breaking points (exclisive) need to have min and max. Value of  min will be 2, because 1 is used by breaking boint,  value of max will be `max-min + 2` so if `min == 10` and `max == 15` the value of max wold be `15-10+2 = 17`.  And value of `ans[i] = a[i]-min+2`.

I need left breaking  point, max and min, to start moving left and fill the answers.  

Looks like this concept would not work because of fall after plato. So need to count a height of breaking point. And good Idea is to add minimums to begining and and of the array thus there no need to add someting additonal cases to the algorithm. And a begining already breaking points.
