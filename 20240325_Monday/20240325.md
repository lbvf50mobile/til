**Go: Put number in its place.**

Idea is to put numbers in theirs places `n` into `n-1` index. And select each
number that is not in its place. 

Go code:
```Go

package main

func findDuplicates(nums []int) []int {
	// Hint from DBabichev's solution.
	// Put numbers in places.
	n := nums
	ans := make([]int, 0, len(n)/2)
	for i, _ := range n {
		// Need to replace: n[i]-1 != i;
		// And there is a reason: n[i]-1 != n[n[i]-1];
		for n[i]-1 != i && n[i] != n[n[i]-1] {
			n[i], n[n[i]-1] = n[n[i]-1], n[i]
		}
	}
	for i, v := range n {
		if v-1 != i {
			ans = append(ans, v)
		}
	}
	return ans
}
```
