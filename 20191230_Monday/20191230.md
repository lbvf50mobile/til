## Kpapsack problem FAQ

May be this is still feels like magnic. This section answer some common questions.

### What happens if you add an item?

Suppose you realize there's a fourth item you can steal that you didn't notice before! You can also steal an iPhone.

**iPhone $2000 1 lb**

Do you have to recalculate everything to account for this new item? Nope. Remeber, dynamic programming keeps progressiverly building on your estimate. So far, there are the max values.

type | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Guitar | $ 1500 G | $ 1500 G | $ 1500 G  |  $ 1500 G 
Stereo | $ 1500 G | $ 1500 G  | $ 1500 G | $ 3000 S
Laptop | $ 1500 G | $ 1500 G |  $2000 L | $ 3500 LG 



That means for a 4 lb knapsack, you can steal $3,500 worth of goods. You thought that was the final max value. But let's add a row of the iPhone.
