**Ruby: Two pointers and answer array.**


Create pointer per input array, start loop while both pointers in bound of arrays. On each iteration find the bigger (most right) left bound and smaller (most left)  right bound check these bound in both arrays to add a new interval to the answer. Move pointer for an interval smaller right bound. That's it. Let's try.
