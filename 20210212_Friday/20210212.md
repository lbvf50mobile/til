Address of subproblem for this task is an index in the array, need to select max from all indices. For each index called a function that seeks for all paris that could be selected after the current pair, i.e. part that first elements in bigger that curren second element. And the max one is found and 1 is added to this max, because 1 is a number when we consider current pair. That it. Now let's code.


I did no read carefull and that why I fail!
Ruby code:   
```Ruby 
# Leetcode: 646. Maximum Length of Pair Chain.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-pair-chain/
# @param {Integer[][]} pairs
# @return {Integer}
# Fail on: [[3,4],[2,3],[1,2]]
# Please read more carefull!
def find_longest_chain(pairs)
    @pr = pairs
    @dp = Array.new(pairs.size)
    max = 0
    (0...@pr.size).each do |i|
        tmp = rec(i)
        max = tmp if tmp > max
    end
    max
end

def rec(i)
    return @dp[i] if @dp[i]
    max = 0
    (i+1...@pr.size).each do |j|
        if @pr[j][0] > @pr[i][1]
            tmp = rec(j)
            max = tmp if tmp > max
        end
    end
    @dp[i] = 1 + max
end
```

Ok now to avoid failing I going to sort input array by first element ascending.     

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 646. Maximum Length of Pair Chain.

# Runtime: 1092 ms, faster than 20.00% of Ruby online submissions for Maximum Length of Pair Chain.
# Memory Usage: 210.4 MB, less than 20.00% of Ruby online submissions for Maximum Length of Pair Chain.
# @param {Integer[][]} pairs
# @return {Integer}
def find_longest_chain(pairs)
    @pr = pairs.sort_by(&:first)
    @dp = Array.new(@pr.size)
    max = 0
    (0...@pr.size).each do |i|
        tmp = rec(i)
        max = tmp if tmp > max
    end
    max
end

def rec(i)
    return @dp[i] if @dp[i]
    max = 0
    (i+1...@pr.size).each do |j|
        if @pr[j][0] > @pr[i][1]
            tmp = rec(j)
            max = tmp if tmp > max
        end
    end
    @dp[i] = 1 + max
end
```
