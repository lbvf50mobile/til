**Ruby: Two hashmaps, source, and subseq by last element.**


There are must not be a duplicated elements. At the end. Each sequence must be uniq. Ok. Let's look at the solution.

Solution based on the [lee215 code](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-into-consecutive-subsequences/discuss/106514/C%2B%2BPython-Esay-Understand-Solution).

Start reasoning.

1. Need to put every element somewhere. And let us have a `source` counter data structure to get elements from.
2. On each iteration over an `array` we take element from the `source` counter, and decreasing amount of the element in the `counter`. Great.
3. If there are no such elemets just move forward.
4. Need to read descripition carefully!
5. Need to read description carefully!
6. Need to read a description of a tast carefully!
7. Ok sorry. Now let's come back to the task. Situation is that sequences are strictly consecutive, and next element always previous+1. That simplify a task significatly.
8. If there is some sequence where current element could be added `destination[i-1]`.  Remove old `sequence` add new one.
9. If it is possible to start new subcequence when `source[i+1]` and `source[i+2]` exists. Add new subsequence in the `destination`.
10. If it is not possible to `extend` existed one or create new one return `false`.
11. If reach the end of the loop return true.

Summary. Each element must be moved from `source` to `desitnation`. If it is imposible to use element from the `source` return `false`. Subsequence defined by it right most element. Subsecuence are strictly consecutive. Need to read a description very carefully.

Let's try to implement without looking in the code.
