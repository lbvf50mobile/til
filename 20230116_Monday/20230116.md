**Ruby/Go: Pop and Push.**

Pre enter new element into the answer array. Create a loop over the intervals array. At the each iteration of the loop pop last element of the answer array. If new element overlaps with poped one - merge and insert, otherwise make two pushs: incoming element and just poped one. The order of two pushs defined by the starts of the elements.
