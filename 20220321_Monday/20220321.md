**Ruby: Length of prefix must be sum of symbol matches.**

1) Create counter. That stores number of matches of symbols in the string.
2) Separate prefix. When prefix length equal sum of amounts of each symbol in the string.

Let's try.

Ruby code:

def partition_labels(s)
  @counter = s.chars.each_with_object(Hash.new){|e,o| o[e] ||= 0; o[e] += 1}
  answer = []
  require "set"
  @chars = Set.new
  length = 0
  s.chars.each do |x|
    length += 1
    @chars.add(x)
    if get_length() == length
      answer.push(length)
      @chars.clear
      length = 0
    end
  end

def get_length()
  @chars.sum{|x| @counter[x]}
end
