**Ruby: Bottom up DP, tail recursion.**

This solution is a tail recursion. Each call has two loops, that generate new hash table with characters and numbers. Each character represents a number of strings started with this character.

External loop intereates over key for new hash map, internal loop iterates for words that going to append to the current key from the extarnal loop. Appending string must be greate or equal to the key.


Generally constuct new word, from a starting char the key, and word from previous iteration.
