**Ruby: Create Hash Map where key is file content and a value array of files.**

Trick of this task is to return only duplicates. When created a Hash Map where keys are contets and values are paths, need to select values that contain more than one element.

Solution is main loop over all catalogs, split catalog string to path and files. Split each file in name and content. Concatinate path and name get full path - it will be an element in the value array of the hash map. And a key would be content.

      @hash[content] ||= []
      @hash[content].push(dir + "/" + name)
    end
  end
  @hash.values.select{|x| x.size > 1 }

  arr = str.split(" ")
  [arr[0],arr[1..-1]]

def extract_content(str)
  arr=str.split(?()
  [arr[0],arr[1][0...-1]]
