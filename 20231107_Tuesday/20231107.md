**Ruby/Go: Count while element is bigger then index in sorted array.**

Cannon fires on each natural number 0, 1, 2 and so on. Shot must be implemented
before a monster came. Need create array with times when monsters arrive, sort
this array increasingly and count element that less then index. Indices are
times when the cannon shots accurs.

Based on the Leetcode's [soluton](https://leetcode.com/problems/eliminate-maximum-number-of-monsters/solution/) translated from Python to Ruby and Go.
