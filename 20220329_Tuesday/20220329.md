**Ruby: Using array.**

Create array `n+1` size filled with `false`. Iterate over input array and check do the value is market as visited in a newly crated array. If so return this value. Value of the input array could be used as indices of newly created array.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby

def find_duplicate(nums)
  arr = Array.new(nums.size, false)
  nums.each do |x|
    return x if arr[x]
    arr[x] = true
  end
  raise "Unknown condition."
