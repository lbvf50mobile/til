In this solution need to be aware for using regex, because regex does not wield well with overlapping substring. This solution uses the helper functions that generate substitution substring composed from two characters different from character before and after question marks chunk. Required function itself implemented as loop over string indices with a nested loop to run over question mark substrings.
