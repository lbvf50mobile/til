# Leetcode: 1504. Count Submatrices With All Ones. (day three.)


For each row i, create an array nums where: if mat[i][j] == 0 then nums[j] = 0 else nums[j] = nums[j-1] +1.

In the row i, number of rectangles between column j and k(inclusive) and ends in row i, is equal to SUM(min(nums[j, .. idx])) where idx go from j to k. Expected solution is O(n^3).
