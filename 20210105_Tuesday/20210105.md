# Leetcode: 1504. Count Submatrices With All Ones. (day three.)


For each row i, create an array nums where: if mat[i][j] == 0 then nums[j] = 0 else nums[j] = nums[j-1] +1.

In the row i, number of rectangles between column j and k(inclusive) and ends in row i, is equal to SUM(min(nums[j, .. idx])) where idx go from j to k. Expected solution is O(n^3).

I did not finished task today, so I add some tiny tasks instead.

```Python
def task(w,n,c):
    names = {'Monday':"James", "Tuesday":"John", "Wednesday":"Robert", "Thursday":"Michael", "Friday":"William" }
    return f'It is {w} today, {names[w]}, you have to work, you must spray {n} trees and you need {n*c} dollars to buy liquid'
```
```Ruby
def task(w,n,c)
  x = {
    'Monday' => "James",
    "Tuesday" => "John",
    "Wednesday" => "Robert",
    "Thursday" => "Michael",
    "Friday" => "William"
  }
  "It is #{w} today, #{x[w]}, you have to work, you must spray #{n} trees and you need #{n*c} dollars to buy liquid"
end
```
```JavaScript
let x = {'Monday':'James',
         'Tuesday':'John',
         'Wednesday':'Robert',
        'Thursday':"Michael",
        'Friday': "William"}
let task = (w,n,c) => `It is ${w} today, ${x[w]}, you have to work, you must spray ${n} trees and you need ${n*c} dollars to buy liquid`
```
