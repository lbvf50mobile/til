**Ruby/Go: Bit manipulaton.**

Instead of saving strings or hash maps better to compare bit masks. Bitwise AND of two words must return 0.

1. Select only works where all chars a uniq.
2. Maps strings into lenght bit mask pairs.
3. Create backtracking method that has threel parameters index, total_mask and total_length.
4. Call this method over all elements with zero total_mask and zero length.
5. Return the answer.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
```
