**Ruby: Strings and map, Numbers and shift.**


Two solutions.

First one. Convert number to binary representation strings, adjust strings length by prepending zeros. Convert strings to arrays zipt them, map similar paris to `0` different to `1` and return an array sum.

Ruby code:
```Ruby

def hamming_distance(x, y)
  x,y = x.to_s(2), y.to_s(2)
  x = x.rjust(40,?0)
  y = y.rjust(40,?0)
  x.chars.zip(y.chars).map{|(x,y)| x != y ? 1 : 0}
    .sum
end
```
