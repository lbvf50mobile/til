**Ruby: Strings and Map, Numbers and Shift.**


Two solutions.

First one. Convert number to binary representation strings, adjust strings length by prepending zeros. Convert strings to arrays zip them, map similar pairs to `0` different to `1` and return an array sum.

Second one. While one of the numbers is not `nil` extract the last byte, compare, add, then binary sift right. Return the sum.

Ruby code (first one):
