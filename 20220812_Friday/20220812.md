**Ruby: Recursive solution. Never use p as an argument in Ruby!**

First thing fisrt `p` is a [Kernel#p](https://apidock.com/ruby/Kernel/p).

Second.

There are three possible cases.

1. LCA has `p` and `q` from the left and right.
2. `p` is LCA and `q` is a descendand.
3. `q` is LCA and `p` is a descendand.

So the task is to determine are there `q` or `p` in the subtree left or right. That means the method must return valid value if there is something in brach or false if there is nothing.

Create a recursive solution if root is nil return nil. If root is q return q. If root is q return p.
And then ask left tree by the recursive call, ask right tree by the recursive call. If left and right return root. This is the first possible case. Otherwise return value from the valid sub tree.
