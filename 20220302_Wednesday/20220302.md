**Ruby: Two pointers.**

Iterate over `t` string, whenever `t` pointer point at the same character with `s` pointer move `s` pointer forward. When step out of the `s` return true.

Let's try.

Ruby code:

def is_subsequence(s, t)
  return true if s.size == 0
  return false if s.size > t.size
  sp = 0 # s pointer.
  t.chars.each do |char|
    if s[sp] == char
      sp += 1
      return true if sp == s.size
    end
  end
  return false
end
```
