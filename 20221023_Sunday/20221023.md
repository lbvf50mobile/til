# Leetcode: 645. Set Mismatch.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/b1aeb0edfc9ede553b48e5f9ca867d76

**Ruby/Go: Find duplicated find missed.**

- Minimum is 1.
- Maximum is size of an array. Because of one is duplicated, but amount still the same.
- Create a counter array with size max+1. To use indexes when seeking for substitued.
- Find duplicated. By a frist loop and increase counter array setting duplicate var when counter is 2.
- Find missed. By looping over the counter array and finde index with zero value.
- Return.


Let's try.
