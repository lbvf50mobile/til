**Ruby: Up to 1 when sum is less than 1.**

If step_by_step value is less than 1, need to require an additional number. The Sum of this requires is the answer we are looking for. 

If the current sum is less than 1 add `1 - sum`. The answer is a sum of all these additions.  

Let's try.

```

```

The minimum value of the answer is 1, so even if all digits are positive need to return 1.
