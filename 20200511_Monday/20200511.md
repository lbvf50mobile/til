        - If hash has only integer keys, and need to increase all keys it's possible use encapsulated hash ans access elements by `h[key - key_offset]`. Were store offset. For example to elements in hash `{0:8,2:5}` increase all keys on tow `{2:8, 4:5}`. To access to elements without changing places in hash its possible to `h[key - 2] => h[2-2] => h[0] = 8`. And the same with adding for example need to add element with `key = 3`.  `h[key - 2] => h[3-2] => h[1]` just between `0 key` and `1 key` in original hash.
