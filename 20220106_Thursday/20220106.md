**Ruby: Emulation of 1000 stops and a car with 1000 rows table.**


The number of stops is small only 1000 elements. It is possible just iterante over them and exit the mothod with `false` in a case of error. Also, if a loop is finished return `true`.

Ok. Car repereented as a table with 1000 rows, where number how many people must exit car on this stop. 
- When arrive to a stop number of people that goint to exit must be numbe or people in car. It not return `false`.
- Next need to enter a car number of users. If there are not enough sits return `false`.
- Car has a counter of free seats. If it is less then zero. Return `false`.

Also need to to generate an array who going to enter the car on the each stop. And then create a loop that controls correctness.

Let's try.
