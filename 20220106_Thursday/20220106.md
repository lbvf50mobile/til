**Ruby: Emulation of 1000 stops and a car with 1000 rows table.**


The number of stops is small only 1000 elements. It is possible to just iterate over them and exit the method with `false` in a case of error. Also, if a loop is finished return `true`.

Ok. The car is represented as a table with 1000 rows, where number how many people must exit the car at this stop. And the amount free sits. 
- When arriving at a stop number of people that going to exit must be equal in "car journal" and in the "array". The array stores the number of people to exit at a certain index. It does not return `false`.
- Next need to enter the car number of users. If there are not enough sits return `false`.
- Car has a counter of free seats. If it is less than zero. Return `false`.

Let's try.

Two data structures are used. The number of people to exit on a stop. An array of pairs: number of people and their destination for each stop. Also, the car has its own data structure equal to the first one, a map with a number of people to exit. 

This duplication of the first data structure helps me during debugging.
