**Ruby: Create palindrome extending pair or element.**

Core of this solution is to build palidnrome from pair indices or one index by growing up left and right. 
Save maximum length in the variable, with initial value 0. There is no sence to start from index 0, need to start from index 1 because it is more convinient for code, and possible to check first pair, and first 3 palindrome. Palindrome length of one would be created automatically every time. Or retrived automaicaly if be more concrete in words.  

Let's try.

In first solutoin I saved string ans an answer and always increase a string. That approach required a lot of resources and leads to TLE. At the [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/discuss/2156659/Python-Easy-O(1)-Space-approach) the same algorithm uses only a pointers. It was a hint. Really appreciate for @constantine786 for his article.
