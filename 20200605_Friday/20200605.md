Convert string to array of chars, map this array into array of value-index paris. Use Ruby chunk_while method to get array of **consecutive** same symbols (consecutive queue of particular symbol). Select from these arrays ones that have at least 3 elements size. Map this arrays into pairs extracting indices of first and last elements.
