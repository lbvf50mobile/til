# Leetcode: 147. Insertion Sort List.

**Ruby: Two heads, one is for sorted, second for unsorted.**

Createa two pointers to the heads of two lists, first one is sorted one, second list is unsorted.  
Create loop until `unsorted_pointer` points to a `nil`.   
In the each iteration unconect element from `unsorted_list`, set new `unsorted_pointer` and insert this element into the `sorted_list`.   

For inserting in to the `sorted_list` two methods would help.
- `change_head` if `inserting_element` is less then `sorted_pointer`, in this case substitute the `sorted_pointer` by an `inserting_element`.
- `insert_into` find conditions when current element in `sorted_list` is less than `inserting_element` and the next one is bigger or `nil`, then insert the `inserting_element` after the current element. Setting next of the current element to the iserting and iserting to the next.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 147. Insertion Sort List.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/insertion-sort-list/
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :next
#     def initialize(val = 0, _next = nil)
#         @val = val
#         @next = _next
#     end
# end
# @param {ListNode} head
# @return {ListNode}
def insertion_sort_list(head)
  return head if head.nil?
  return head if head.next.nil?
    
end
```
