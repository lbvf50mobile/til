Ok. How to lets makes square solution.

Starting from each position. First must be open. Last must be close.
Level must be zero.

Having one pass could be saved "valid intervals". And this valid intervals could be saved in stack. As well as into the hash. But. This is not correct what if need to start from some other point?

Ok lets write first simplest `O(N*N)` solution.
Longest started from `i` interval. Thats briliant.

Ruby code:
