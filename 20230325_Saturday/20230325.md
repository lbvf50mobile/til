**Ruby: Combination with optimization.**

The answer is combination of paris where first element is from one component ans second from another. And it could be optimized if have a vairable of total visited nodes and every interation of bfs appand this total to an answer, and at the end of the bfs method update the total value by a counter of nodes in current component. Because there is no any differens for node of a current component do the all other nodes in a single component or in a set of components, only amount of element of other components is important.

  # Need to calulate combinations

  # Where first elment of a pairt is from one component.
  # And second element is from an anothe component.

  # Optimization. For current component there is no difference
  # other part of pair is in single component or in several ones.
  # So with `total` var it is possible to increase the answer inside the BFS.
