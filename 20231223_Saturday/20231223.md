# Leetcode: 1496. Path Crossing.

**Go: A two elements arrays as a maps key.**

The solution is based on the Hash Map where keys are two-element arrays. This
map answers the question "Has this point been visited before?". Also, a map
for deltas is used to define how to change a position depending on a current
move.
