**Ruby: Pull DP, fist row and column of ones.**

1. Create `m*n` matrix.
2. Fill first row and collumn by ones.
3. Use pull DP technique on the rest of a matrix.
4. Return `matrix[m-1][n-1]`.

Let's try.

P.S. [Notes about DB by Kamil Debowsky "Errichto"](https://github.com/Errichto/youtube/wiki/DP-lecture).

About errors I made this time during coding:  
Put `0` instead of `1` when interate over the rest of a matrix.

Ruby code:

      matrix[i][j] += matrix[i-1][j]
      matrix[i][j] += matrix[i][j-1]
    end
  end
  # Return the bottom right cell.
  matrix[m-1][n-1]
end
```
