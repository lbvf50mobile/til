Maximum number of steps to make `a` and `b` consecutive is `b - a - 1`.
First is to make order in variables `a1 < b1 < c1`, rearrange values such way, to make it convenient to wor with them, reorder values in variables for example to have `a < b < c`. And calculated differences from a to b, from b to c, and min and max difference b.

- If all variables consecutive there is no other value but `0 == min`, and `0 == max`.
- If two two stones of three are consecutive `min = 1`, and `max = max_distance  - 1`.
- If there is one step gap between to stones `minimum_distance == 2`, `min = 1`, `max = min_distance - 1 + max_distance -1`.
- And if instance is not listed above `min = 2`, and `max = min_distance - 1 + max_distance - 1`.
