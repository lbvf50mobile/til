**Ruby: Fill array, count number of fills, compare with n.**

The idea of this solution is to fill the array with ones where they must be. And compare a number of fills with n.

A flower could be planted when.

- Current value is zero.
- If it is zero index, index one must contain zero two.
- If it is the last index, the previous index must contain zero.
- If it is somewhere in the middle previous and next indices must contain zero.
 
The solution would be a loop that fills the array with ones and increase the counter. Then counter compares with `n`.

Let's try.

  f = flowerbed
  flowerbed.each_with_index do |x,i|
    if x == 0 
      a = (0 == i) && (f[i+1] == 0)
      b = (last == i) && (f[i-1] == 0)
      c = (i != last) && (0 != i) && 0 == f[i-1] && 0 == f[i+1]
      if a || b || c
        f[i] = 1
        counter += 1
      end
    end
    return true if n <= counter
  end
  n <= counter
end
```
