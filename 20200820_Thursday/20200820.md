To solve this task at first need to calculate amount of prime numbers in range from 1 till n inclusive. Number of composite numbers will be subtraction prime amount from n. In this task number and index are similar because indices are 1 based, and prime numbers could swap between their indices as composite could do the same. Need to multiply permutations of prime numbers on permutation of composite numbers. And be careful when n equal to 1, because in this situation Ruby ranges converted to arrays will be return empty arrays, and Enumerable#reduce will return nil.
