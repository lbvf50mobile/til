Need to calculate amount of prime numbers in range from 1 til n inclusive. Number of composite numbers will be subtraction prime amount from n. In this task number and index are similar because indices are 1 based, and prime numbers could swap between their indices as composite could do the same. Need to multiply permutations of prime numbers on permutation of composite numbers. And be careful when n equal to 1, because in this situation Ruby ranges converted to arrays will be return empty arrays, and Enumerable#reduce will return nil.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 1175. Prime Arrangements.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-arrangements/
# @param {Integer} n
# @return {Integer}
require 'prime'
def num_prime_arrangements(n)
    return 1 if n == 1
    prime = (1..n).count{|x| Prime.prime?(x)}
    compose = n - prime
    ((1..compose).reduce(&:*) * (1..prime).reduce(&:*)) % (10**9 + 7)
end
```
