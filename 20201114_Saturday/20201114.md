**Ruby: Extract words into an array by the regex, count spaces, then join.**

**Ruby: Gap size is floor division spaces by decreased words number, same but module for a tail.**

Corner cases are when there is one word or no spaces.  Otherwise gap size is floor division total number of spaces by words number decreased by one, number of tails spaces is the same formula as above but with rest operator. Words extracted into an array by the regex, number of spaces counted by count method.
