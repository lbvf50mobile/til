# Leetcode: 143. Reorder List.

**Ruby: Save pointers in array, use two pointers in a loop.**

- First save pointers to all list notes into the array. Preserving order.
- Second. Set all pointers to nil. This is rule from a multy errors resolved during lists solving.
- Third. Head is the same. Create two indeces `front` already set to the second element and a `back` set to the last eleelement. These indices are from new created array of pointers. And a main loop variable `i` that initially set to `1`. On the odd iteration apped `back` and decrease `back`, on the even iteration prepend `front` and increase it. And a rule `front <= back`, because pointer poits on the next element to use.
- Or the number of steps could be controlled by the `i` it must be `array.size-1` iteration.
