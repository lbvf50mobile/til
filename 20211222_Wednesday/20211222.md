**Ruby: Save pointers in an array, use two pointers in a loop.**

- First, save pointers to all list notes into the array. Preserving order.
- Second. Set all pointers to nil. This is the rule from multiple errors resolved during list solving.
- Third. The Head is the same. Create two indices `front` already set to the second element and a `back` is set to the last element. These indices are from the newly created array of pointers. And a main loop variable `i` that initially set to `1`. On the odd iteration append `back` and decrease `back`, on the even iteration prepend `front` and increase it. And a rule is `front <= back` because the pointer points to the next element to use.
- Or the number of steps could be controlled by the `i` it must be `array.size-1` amount of iterations.
