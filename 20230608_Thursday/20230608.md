- https://leetcode.com/problems/count-negative-numbers-in-a-sorted-matrix/discuss/3614532/RubyGo%3A-Negative-elements-in-the-bottom-right-part.

**Ruby/Go: Negative elements in the bottom-right part.**

- Ruby: oneliner.
- Go: move bottom up, right left, updating left border of the inner loop condition.
