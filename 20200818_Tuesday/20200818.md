To recognize a word to be formed by some list of characters need to perform two conditions:
- Each character of this word must be in the list.
- Number of each type character must be less or equal to number of this characters in the list.

To check this conditions. Need to create histogram of the list, and histogram of each word. And then check these conditions to each character of a word.
