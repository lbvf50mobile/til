To recognize a word to be formed by some list of characters need to perform two conditions:
- Each character of this word must be in the list.
- Number of each type character must be less or equal to number of this characters in the list.

To check this conditions. Need to create histogram of the list, and histogram of each word. And then check these conditions to each character of a word.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/find-words-that-can-be-formed-by-characters/discuss/799378/Ruby-solution%3A-Represent-histogram-as-an-array-check-conditions-by-deduction.

Core idea of this solution is to use array as histogram, number of matches of each character stored at zero based index of this character, where a is 0, b is 1, c is 2 and so on. Having such kind of array filled with number of matches it is possible to delete 1 each time a character appears in a word, if there is a negative value sotred at appropriated index after such deduction this means that word could not be created from represented list of chars.
