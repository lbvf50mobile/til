**Ruby: Save in array, integer division, min.**

My idea is to count number of charracters used in ballon, and then divide them by number of times they used in this word. Then select minumum from this number.

Create two arrays, first array is counter where nunber of chars, second array amount of matches of each char in the ballon. When fill array first, divide each element of frist with corresponding element of second and get for how many words this character could be used. And return minimum.

```
b a ll oo n  # Characters.
b a l o n    # Unic charatecers.
0 1 2 3 4    # Index in array to store this characer.
1 1 2 2 1    # Amount of characters in the word.
```

Let's try to code this idea.

Ruby code:

  count = Array.new(5,0)
  amount = [1,1,2,2,1]
  text.chars.each do |char|
    count[0] += 1 if ?b == char
    count[1] += 1 if ?a == char
    count[2] += 1 if ?l == char
    count[3] += 1 if ?o == char
    count[4] += 1 if ?n == char
  end
  count.zip(amount).map{|(a,b)| a/b}.min
end
```
