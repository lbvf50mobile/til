# Leetcode: 1291. Sequential Digits.

**Go: Predefined values.**

This type of number is defined by start digit and length.

If length is 1 there are 9 numbers (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9).
If length is 9 there is 1 number (123456789).

In total there are approximately 50 numbers of this type in range from 1 till
10pow9. It is easy to calculate them and store in a Golang slice. And then
just iterate over all of them selecting ones in the inputs boundaries.
