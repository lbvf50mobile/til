**Ruby: First recursive. Then from the Leetcode's solution.**

Subproblem adress is (i,j,k).
- i - position in the `multipliers`.
- j - left border of `numbers`.
- k - right border of `numbers`.

In a recuresive call  return max from `@m[i]*@n[j] + rec(i+1,j+1,k)` and `@m[i]*@n[k] + rec(i+1,j,k-1)`.  
Where `@m` is a multipliers, and `@n` is a numbers. Also use an `dp[i][j][k]` to aviod several calls on the same path. 

Also if `k < 0 || i == @m.size || j == @n.size` return 0.

Let's try.

Requires to much memory.

Ruby code(1):
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 1770. Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-performing-multiplication-operations/
# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @param {Integer[]} multipliers
# @return {Integer}
# MLE. Memory Limit Exeed.
def maximum_score(nums, multipliers)
  @n, @m = nums, multipliers
  @dp = Array.new(@m.size).map{ Array.new(@n.size).map{ Array.new(@n.size,false)}}
  rec(0,0,@n.size-1)
end

def rec(i,j,k)
  return 0 if (k < 0) || (i >= @m.size) || (j >= @n.size)
  return 0 if j > k # Add this line to be sure.
  return @dp[i][j][k] if @dp[i][j][k]
  max = [@m[i]*@n[j] + rec(i+1,j+1,k), @m[i]*@n[k] + rec(i+1,j,k-1)].max
  @dp[i][j][k] = max
  return max
end
```

Now take code from the leetcode's soltuion.
But this leads to TLE.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 1770. Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-performing-multiplication-operations/
# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @param {Integer[]} multipliers
# @return {Integer}
# TLE.
def maximum_score(nums, multipliers)
  # Based on.
  # https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-performing-multiplication-operations/solution/
  @m,@n = multipliers, nums
  m,n = multipliers.size, nums.size
  dp = [0] * (m+1)
  (0...m).reverse_each do |op|
    next_row = dp.clone
    # Present Row is now next_row because we are moving upwards.
    (0..op).reverse_each do |left|
      dp[left] = [@m[op]*@n[left] + next_row[left+1], @m[op] * @n[n-1-(op-left)] + next_row[left]].max
    end
  end
  dp[0]
end

```

And that's why I use C code.

```C

int max(int a, int b) { return a > b ? a : b; }

    int n = numsSize, m = multipliersSize;
    int dp[m + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) dp[i] = 0;

                           multipliers[op] * nums[n - 1 - (op - left)] + next_row[left]);
        }
    }
    return dp[0];
}
