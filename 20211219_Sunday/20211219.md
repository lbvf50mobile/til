**Ruby: Level 0 to answer, level 1 to a recursive call.**

Short: At the level zero save data straight into the answer. At the end of the level one implement a recursive call.

This solution is based on recursion and nested level. Every open bracket increases nested level, every close decreases. When nested level is 0 put characters into the answer, when the nested level is zero and digits push them into the repeat_stack. 

Open bracket at level zero starts argument generation for the recursive call. 
Close bracket on level one implement a recursive call and multiply its answer on value generated one the state of the repeat_stack.
