**Ruby: Sliding window of s1 size.**

Create two `Counter` data structures based on arrays. It is an array where the index stores number of appropriate characters `0` for `a`, `1` for `b` etc.
The sliding window with be the size of `s1` and update one of the counters for interval on `s2`.  If `i` is the first character of the sliding window, the index for `i-1` would be decreased (amount of such characters decreased), and for the character at `i+s1.size-1` amount in the counter would be increased.

On each iteration `Counter` that aggregated on the interval of `s2` would be compared with counter aggregated on `s1`. If they are equal true would be returned otherwise false.
