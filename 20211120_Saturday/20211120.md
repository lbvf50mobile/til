**Ruby: Binary Search, before uniq each pair start at even index.**

First check corner cases one element, uniq element at the bounds.  
Then start binary search and check parity of an index and depeding
of parity check is a single element is left or right. 

Ofcourse first check does the middle is an answer.


Let's try. And I got a hit about inices parity from the [zayne-siew](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/discuss/1587293/Python-3-Simple-Approaches-with-Explanation) article. Really appricate.


Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 540. Single Element in a Sorted Array.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/
# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @return {Integer}
def single_non_duplicate(nums)
    
end
```
