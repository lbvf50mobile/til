Create two hash in both hashes keys are values of the input array. First hash stores frequency, second hash stores first appearance, last, and number number of elements between these appearance inclusive.  Thus after a loop next data available: max frequency, hash wit frequency as value, and hash with length. Now all what need to do, select length from all key with maximum frequency and choose minimum length among them.
