**Ruby: From Up Right to Left Down.**

*Q: Why do you write? UpRight and LeftDown when cells from source first move rigtht then top and puth into destination firs moving left then down?*  
*A: It whas my first drawing when I got how to solve this task. At the left part there was an input matrix at the right part output one, and I found that ROWS source go up and ROWS from destination go down. And in assignment desitnation is left and source is right. This slogan UpRight to LeftDown just sounds good.*   

```
      dest[i_to][j_to] = source[i_from][j_from]
```

Copy current matrix to a temporary one.
Create two loops outer and inner, and copy from the temp matrix to the current one.

From:  
Outer 0..n column.  
Inner n..0 row.  
To:  
Outer 0..n row.  
Innter 0..n column.  

Let's try.

    end
    j_from += 1
    i_to += 1
  end
end
