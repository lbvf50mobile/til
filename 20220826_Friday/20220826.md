**Ruby: Set of strings.**

1. Need to get an array of powers of two till `10**9`.
2. Convert these numbers to strings and sort chars. Create a set from the array.
3. Convert inpur to string sort chars join and check does in include in the set.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby

# Accepted.

def reordered_power_of2(n)
  require "set"
  @two ||= get_powers_of_2()
    .map{|x| x.to_s.chars.sort.join}.to_set
  @two.include?(n.to_s.chars.sort.join)
end

def get_powers_of_2()
  answer = []
  value = 1
  border = 10**9 
  while value <= border
    answer.push value
    value *= 2
  end
  answer
end

```
