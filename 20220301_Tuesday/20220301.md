**Ruby: Get value from the number without the most significant bit.**

This is a DP solution. Numbers constantly repeat in binary representation except for the most significant bit.
Because indices are similar to numbers we exploring, it is possible to get value from the current number without the most significant bit. For this purpose need to use XOR with a power of two. 

Store two variables `curr_power` and `next_power`, when number is two in `next_power` update them. Use `curr_power` to generate index for DP.

Let's try.

  (2..n).each do |i|
    if next_value == i
      curr_power += 1
      next_power += 1
      curr_value = 1<<curr_power
      next_value = 1<<next_power
    end
    index = i ^ curr_value
    ans[i] = 1 + ans[index]
  end
  return ans
