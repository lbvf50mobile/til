# Articulation Points (or Cut Vertices) in a Graph

# A vertes in an undirected connceted graph is an atriculation point
# (or cut vertex) if revoming it (and gedges thought it)  disconnects the graph.
# Articulation points represent vulnerabilities in a connected network - single points
# whose failure would split the network into 2 or more disconnected components. They
# are useful for desiging reliable networks.

# For a disconnected undirected graph, an articulation point is a vertex remoting
# which increases number of connected components.

# Following are some example graphs with articulation points encircled with red color.
