First trap is that here are two indexes j - index in array A and i - index of query. Need to save index of query.

To make this code acceptable need make it complexity O(n). So get initial sum of even element. And then in each query modify it.
For possible variants:

- query.even element.even: Even sum increased on query size.
- query.odd element.odd: Even sum increased on query+element size. New element become even.
- query.odd element.even: Even sum decreased by element size. One element become odd.
- query.even element.odd: Even some does not changed.
