**Ruby: Min, max, current.**


Subtask is the maximum consecutive subarray that starts at an index. But because the multiplication of two negative multipliers gives positive one needs to store minimum and maximum. And select new values from the current value and current value multiplied by the next min/max. Thus selecting from three variants.

Each cell stores two values min and max. This is a result of multiplications of subsequent elements.
To generate this value need to select minimum and maximum from current, current by next max, current by next min.   


Create a method to select a minimum from three elements and a maximum from three elements. And use this to calculate the minimum and maximum for a current cell. Moving left from the last to the first index.   

Let's try.
