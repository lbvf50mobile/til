- https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-pruning/discuss/2541079/Ruby%3A-DFS.-Remove-subtree-if-false.-True-if-l-or-r-or-one.

**Ruby: DFS. Remove subtree if false. True if l or r or one.**

In general create DFS. DFS return false if the argument is nil. Then asks for left and right recurcive calls, nil poiters for sides that returns false, answer is true if left true or right true or value is one.

Error. Did not add check for root. Root could be substituted for nil too. Fixed.
