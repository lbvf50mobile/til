Let's discourse:
1. To get the value of a point m[i][j] need to have a sum of all it 8 neighbors and this point itself and divide it on 9.
2. But some times sell has less then 8 neighbors if it stands on a border. In this case need's to calculate amount of neighbors, and divide sum on it.
3. Thus we need to have a map of delta coordinates and when visit a point m[i][j] calculate amount of possible neighbors, and sum of their values.
4. And the time complexity will be O(9*N*M) but because the maximum value  of elements in row or column is 150 the maximum time consuming will be `150*150*9 = 200 * 200 * 10 = 4 0 000`.
5. Let's try.
