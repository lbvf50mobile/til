**Ruby: Hash, Set, and Algebra.**

Everything starts from Algebra.  `n[i] - n[j] = k; n[i] = k + n[j];`;
Ok but thinkgs a little bit more complicate, because there is an absolute value.  

`|n[i] - n[j]| = k` means two possible vairants.

- `n[i] - n[j] = k; n[i] = k + n[j]; `
- `n[i] - n[j] = -k; n[i] = n[j] - k;` 
  
Need to check both of them. Now it is `j` and definetely one `j`, and number of paris generatind this `j` would be equal number of `n[i]` values which stends befroe `j`. This number could be found by asking: `HashCounter[n[i]]` how many such values were met. But we do not know `n[i]` but we know `n[i] = k + n[j] or n[i] = n[j] - k`.


But this would be all kinds of pairs, and only **unique** pairs need to be counted. This could be used by a Set data structure. Create for each type of pair the key. And always add a key to the Set, the data structure going to manage itself to it need to add a key or it is already added. After the loop just return the size of the Set.


Let's try.

    key2 = ni_2 > nj ? "#{nj},#{ni_2}" : "#{ni_2},#{nj}"
    if k != 0 && hash_counter[ni_1]

    end
    if k != 0 && hash_counter[ni_2]
      ans_set.add(key2)
    end
    if k == 0 && hash_counter[ni_1]
      ans_set.add(key1)
    end
    hash_counter[nj] ||= 0
    hash_counter[nj] += 1
  end
  ans_set.size
