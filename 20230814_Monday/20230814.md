# Leetcode: 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/discuss/3909572/Ruby%3A-Containers%3A%3AMinHeap-always-brings-TLE.

**Ruby: Containers::MinHeap always brings TLE.**

First normal solution, with a [MinHeap](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/kanwei/algorithms/Containers/MinHeap) of size k.

- Push while Heap size less than k.
- Pop and Push if Heap's top is less than current.

Need to have a smallest from k lartes.

Okay but because this normal solution is always TLE, because of Lib, a hack "sort
and select".


Ruby code (Heap):
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/
# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @param {Integer} k
# @return {Integer}
# TLE.
def find_kth_largest(nums, k)
  # https://www.rubydoc.info/github/kanwei/algorithms/Containers/MinHeap
  # A MinHeap is a heap where the items are returned in ascending order of key value.

  # Need smallest from k larges.
  heap = MinHeap.new([])
  nums.each do |x|
    if heap.size < k
      heap.push(x)
    else
      if heap.min < x
        heap.pop
        heap.push(x)
      end
    end
  end
  return heap.pop
end
```
