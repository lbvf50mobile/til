# Leetcode: 2265. Count Nodes Equal to Average of Subtree.

**Ruby/Go: DFS that returns sum and amount of nodes.**

**Note:** Need to read description carefully and spend 10 minutes on reading
even if it looks to obvious. The price for optimization is incorrect submitions
and failed interview. Spend more time on reading! It always paid offs!

Two variants of DFS: Ruby's one increase global valiable, Go's one return number
of nodes that have similar value and aveage inside a return.
