**Ruby: Counter data structure, loop over unique values, compare keys, reduce doubled ones.**

Create a Counter data structure, iterate over uniq values of the array, check there are more doubled values in counter, write current value in the answer, reduce number of doubled values in the couter.

Zeros are corner cases add them separate after the loop.

Answer array must be a half size of input array, this leads to optimizaiton if an array size is odd return emtpy array.
