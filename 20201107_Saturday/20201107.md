**Ruby: Increase counter on 'single one' row and column and the element is one.**

Create boolean array of rows with true marked ones with only one 1. Same array for columns. Iterate over all elements of a matrix in the nested loop and increase counter when corresponding row index stores true in the rows array, column index stores true either, and current element is one. I called lines with single "one" element as "lucky", and counter is increased when row and column lines are "lucky" and the current element is 1.
