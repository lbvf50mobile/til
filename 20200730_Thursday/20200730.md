Recursive solution. Created instance variable `sum`, and on every leaf to this `sum` added a number created from sequence of nodes values. This reached by creating depth first search recursive function that stores sequence number in a special argument, and when node.left and node.right are empty this numeric value is added to the `sum`. This recursive function is called from `sum_root_to_leaf`.
