Recursive solution. Created instance variable `sum`, and on every leaf to this `sum` added a number created from sequence of nodes values. This reached by creating depth first search recursive function that stores sequence number in a special argument, and when node.left and node.right are empty this numeric value is added to the `sum`. This recursive function is called from `sum_root_to_leaf`.

#         @val = val

def sum_root_to_leaf(root)
    @sum = 0
    dfs(root,0) if root
    @sum 
end

def dfs(root, sum)
        sum = sum*2 + root.val
        dfs(root.left, sum) if root.left
        dfs(root.right, sum) if root.right
end       
```

Solution without instance variable. Recursive function return sum of sub calls if it is an average node, and updated sum if it is leaf. Sum is the second argument of the function.
