Create two loops one external, one internal both iterates from 0 to 50. Inside internal loop `tmp` is calculated by `x**i + y**j` formula, if `tmp` is less then bound push it inside the `answer` array. When loops are stopped sort `answer` array and leave only unique values inside it.  `2**50` and `100**50` both able to be calculated in `Ruby` and both overcome the `10**6` so this is enough to solve this problem.

UPD: there is no need to add sort before return a value. thnks @quantumlexa.
