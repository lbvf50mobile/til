# Leetcode: 1287. Element Appearing More Than 25% In Sorted Array.

If array is to small like one or two elements just return first value. Other wise start to iterate from second index, and increase counter if previous value equal to current one. When counter would be greater than quarter return this value.


Ruby code:

    return arr[0] if arr.size < 3
    size = arr.suze
    quarter = size.fdiv(4)
    
    counter = 1
    (1...size).each do |i|
        value = arr[i]
        if arr[i-1] == value
            counter += 1
        else
            counter = 1
        end
        return value if quarter < counter
    end
    
    raise "Ha, something must be returned before this line. This is an error!"
