Given two strings `s1, s1`, find the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.

## Hint.

Let dp(i,j) be the answer for inputs s1[i:] and s2[j:].

## Solution tips.

Here need to spend time working with boundaries. And need add one extra row and column in the dp matrix to store position after the end of a string.
