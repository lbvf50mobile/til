# Leetcode: 638. Shopping Offers.

Today I want to store results in multi dimensional array. Okey there are 6 kinds of items a,b,c,d,e,f - maximum 6, and there are 6 items at most. So each requirement could be coded as `dp[a][b][c][d][e][f]` and each letter must have as many positions as many things we could by. So it would be from 0 to 6. Ok let's try to make such thing in memory, would to works? Ok, that's nice such multi dimensional array works (it could be created).       

Next thing is to implement an method that accepted required amount of arguments, and for this reason each special offer should be extended by zeros, to always work with required amount of items.   

And I have an Idea to use special offer as many times as possible. And for this purpose I going to create method that return maximum amount of use for this action.  


Created a working model, but it's return TLE. I think need to use better coef counter.

Ruby code:
