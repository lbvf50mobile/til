**Ruby: Array stores input indices by the counter address.**

**Begining of the reasoning.** 
The length of a subarray must be `2n` where `n` is a sum of its elements.
If we have the current `max`, the next max might be at `max+2`, `max+4`, `max+8`, and so on.
And the sum must be `(new_max/2)`.

Ok and what if store `sums` and indices as values?
It is possible to start ... but what is the difference? It is possible to just iterate over intervals and check prefix sums.

But his is too long.

**Moment where I went for the solution.**

At this moment I went to https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-array/solution/ to get the optimal solution.

  arr = Array.new(2*nums.size + 1,-2)
  count = 0
  max = 0
  arr[nums.size] = - 1
  nums.each_with_index do |value,i|
    count += (value == 1 ? 1 : -1)
    index = count + nums.size
    if arr[index] >= - 1     
      max = i - arr[index] if max < i - arr[index]
    else
      arr[index] = i
    end
  end
  max
end
```
