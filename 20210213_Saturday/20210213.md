This is an interesting task, need to draw, a possibilities. For 1 chair is clear, the same for 2. But when 3 chairs, interesting things begins.
1/3 if first one seats on his place.               
1/3 if he sits on place of a third user.               
and in 1/3 he sits on the place of second user. And here with be 1/2 that third one will get his place.   

1/3 + (1/3)*1/2 = 1/3 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 1/2 = 3/6 = 1/2;

Answer will always be 0.5. It is amazing.  By advise of @jabascripter, I wanted to add more computations. For 4 and for 5. And it is the same as for 3.
