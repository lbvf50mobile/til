**Ruby: Modified iterative BFS to make DFS.**

Use modified BFS to have DFS for iterating over the tree. Instead of unshift/push would be pop/push. Solution is DFS and constructing Linked List.

Let's try.

Ruby code:

  last = root
  q = []
  q.push(last) if root
  while ! q.empty?
    el = q.pop
    r,l = el.right, el.left
    el.right, el.left = nil, nil
    if el != last
      last.right = el
      last.left = nil
      last = last.right
    end
    q.push(r) if r
    q.push(l) if l
  end
  return root
end
