**Ruby: Push if equal, Pop if less.**

In this task need to generate an answer array equal to the target array, and log all actions in actions array. The result is actions array. If describe the idea shortly if current element of answer array is less then current element in target one - pop this element out. If answer array is empty or if current element equal to the corresponding element in the target array push. Current element for answer array is alway the last one. Pushing increasing number from the list array that contains numbers from 1 till n. This code could be improved by substituting answer array and list array by several integers variables, but this is a first try with purpose to understand the task. Thank you for reading.
