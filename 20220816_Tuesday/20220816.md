**Ruby: Use array as a counter.**

Create an array for 26 elements. These are counters. Iterate over a string for a first time and increase counter every time a symbol matched. Next. Iterate over a sting ones more and return index of first symbol with value 1 in the couter. A symbol converted to an array idex by the `ord` method or by the code of this symbol.

Summary. Two loops, one array. Return `-1` if did not return in the second loop.

Let's try.

P.S. Also it is possible to have an array where store index of first occurance of a symbol. And return minimal occurance with counter 1.
