**Go: S is const. Somewhere grows, the same size shrinks. Return grows.**

Some Math. If there are only `1` and `0` symbols in the alphabet. Then there
`x` of ones and `y` of zeros in the `s`. `x+y = const`.

In the `t` amount of elements is the same `const`. So if add some to `x` would
not change the `const`.

`(x+5) + y = const + 5`

And that means:

`(x+5) + y - 5 = const`.

The symbols with bigger amount of matches in `t` equal to number of symbols
with smaller aount of matches in `t`, in compare with `s`.

Need to create a Counter data structures for the both strings, and count delta
(difference) of symbols that has bigger amout. They will `cover` ones with
smaller amount of matches.

Go code (with consideration):
