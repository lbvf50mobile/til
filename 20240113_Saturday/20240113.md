**Go: S is const. Somewhere grows, the same size shrinks. Return grows.**

Number of places in `s` string is a constant.

Each symbol of the alphabet has it's number of places in the `s` string. If
one symbol start to get more places at the string `t` it "eats" that places
from other symbols. The `s` string number of places is a goal for `t`. Thus
need to get the number of overfloated (conquered, captured) places of all
symbols. 

Go code (count conquered positions):

package main

func minSteps(s string, t string) int {
	// Conquered places.
	ans := 0
	countT := counter(t)
	countS := counter(s)
	for i, v := range countS {
		t := countT[i]
		if t > v {
			ans += t - v
		}
	}
	return ans
}

func counter(s string) []int {
	ans := make([]int, 26)
	for _, v := range s {
		ans[int(v-'a')] += 1
	}
	return ans
}
```

Also, it is possible to look from another point if some symbol in `t` has
fewer places than in `s`. He gives that places to the other symbols. Need to
return the number of loosed places.

Go code (count loosed places):
```Go

package main

func minSteps(s string, t string) int {
	// Loosed positions.
	ans := 0
	countS := counter(s)
	countT := counter(t)
	for i, v := range countS {
		t := countT[i]
		if t < v {
			ans += v - t
		}
	}
	return ans
}

func counter(s string) []int {
	ans := make([]int, 26)
	for _, v := range s {
		ans[int(v-'a')] += 1
	}
	return ans
}
```

Some Math. If there are only `1` and `0` symbols in the alphabet. Then there
`x` of ones and `y` of zeros in the `s`. `x+y = const`.

In the `t` amount of elements is the same `const`. So if add some to `x` would
not change the `const`.

`(x+5) + y = const + 5`

And that means:

`(x+5) + y - 5 = const`.

The symbols with bigger amount of matches in `t` equal to number of symbols
with smaller aount of matches in `t`, in compare with `s`.

Need to create a Counter data structures for the both strings, and count delta
(difference) of symbols that has bigger amout. They will `cover` ones with
smaller amount of matches.

Go code (with consideration):

package main

func minSteps(s string, t string) int {
	// If image that there are only two symbols in the alphabet 0 and 1,
	// there will be more one kind and less of other kind of simbols in `t`.
	// Thus there will be two var `more` and `less`. The `s` string is const,
	// so it is possible only compare with `s`. Again, `more` and `less`.
	counterS := counter(s)
	counterT := counter(t)
	more, less := 0, 0
	for i, v := range counterS {
		t := counterT[i]
		if t > v {
			more += t - v
		}
		if t < v {
			less += v - t
		}
	}
	// If there is more of some characters.
	// They bite plase from one thet less.
	// And because the lenght is conts.
	// And there is `s` as ideal: `more == less`.
	// Adding some where, reducing in other place.
	// x: 0; y: 1. x + y = const
	// if x + 5 => x + 5 + y = const - 5
	// x + 5 + y - 5 = const
	// Need to fix 5 elements.
	return more
}

func counter(s string) []int {
	ans := make([]int, 26)
	for _, v := range s {
		index := int(v - 'a')
		ans[index] += 1
	}
	return ans
}
