Description of this task is really unclear, and need to spend some time to calculate what do this mysterious N and 2N means.

Ok. There is an Array of size. And in the company amount there is size amount of people. Half of them must be in city A, and half of them must be in city B. N it is a half of the size of the array.

This task could be solved by dynamic programming approach. Each person could go to A city if there less then half of persons already there, or cold go to B city if less then half of company members already there.  This means for each person and number of team members in each city there is on minimum sum next persons could spend for travel depend on their selection. And this is sum is minimum for select travel to city A and optimal solutions of next people, and travel to city B and optimal solutions of next members.

Thus after comparing this two ways and select minimal one, it is possible to cache this sum for person under index `i` with `X places available to city A` and `Y places available to city B` - this is a core of top-down dynamic programming approach.  Test all possible ways select appropriate and cache it for other calls.

## Leetcode: 1025. Divisor Game.

When n == 2 player wins, when n == 1 player lose.  
If player start with even number he always able to give odd number. But is there a way to pass odd number to opponent  from odd number?
Looks like there are no such way. Odd minus odd always even. And even + even always even as well. There is no way to have even that divide odd without reminder, and once player got odd value, opponent will got even number. And even number is eventually will be two.
