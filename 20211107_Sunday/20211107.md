Solution based on two method. Multyply number by a digit, and multyply number by a power of ten.  
Numbers represented as an arrays, where minumal digit position ocupies minumum index in other words numbers are reversed for example `"12345" => [5,4,3,2,1]`.

Multyplying by a number created as a loop with one variable for a next digit place.  
Multiplying by a power of ten buy unshifting zeros to the array.
 
Ruby code:
