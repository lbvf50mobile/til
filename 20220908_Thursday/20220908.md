**Ruby: Iterative Inorder Traversal.**

Short description. Move left as far as possible til nil, pop nil, write value, move right, repeat.

If write a recursive solution it is very simple: move left, write current, more right.

When criate an iterative solution need to use stack. Loop works while a stack is not empty. In the loop there is a condition, if a top of the stack is not `nil` just push left to the stack, if a top is `nil`: double pop, write, move right.

At the time of double pop check is it possible to pop something.

Let's try.


Errors:

- Instead `answer.push(node.value)` wrote `answer.push(node)`. Fixed.
