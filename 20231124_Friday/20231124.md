**Go: Sort descending, select every second one from the top.**

Alice took bigest.  

You took middle.  

Bob took smallest.  

Sort the array descending. Split it in three equal parts. The smallest one
give to Bob. Split the chunk of the two biggest parts by a consecutive paris,
fisrt element of pair give to Alice, second one take yourself. Thus you going
to have maximum amount of coins.
