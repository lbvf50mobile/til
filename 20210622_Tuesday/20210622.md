**Ruby: Array with indices of reached zeros.**

Idea is to add to array only zeros that could reach other zeros within interval. So create an array add first index there, and then when meet new zero itereate though the array until find zero in bounds, if not, do not add new zero index into the reached zero array. At the end the first element of reached zeros must be a last index of the input string.
