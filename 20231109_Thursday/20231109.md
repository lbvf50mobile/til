**Ruby/Go: Count number of the repeating symbols and accumulate it.**

This solution is a translation of the Leetcode's [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-homogenous-substrings/solution/) from Python to
Ruby and Go.

Base algorithm is to increase counter when current symbol is equal to previous
one and add this number to the answer. To avoid integer overflow use modulo
operation on every addition.
