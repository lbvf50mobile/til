**Go: Root to Border1, Border1 to Border2, return middle of the B2-1 path.**

This solution is deeply explored [DBabichev Soluion](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/discuss/923071/Python-Find-diameter-using-2-dfs-explained).


Prerequisites: If in a tree node add a parent pointer moving by this pointer
Recursively leads to the root. This fact allows to find the farthest leaf from
the root and save the path, thanks for a `parent` pointer.

The solution is: 

1. Select random Root, and find the farthest leaf from the Root, this leaf is
   Border1.

2. Set Border1 as a Root, and find the farthest leaf from the RootBorder1,
   this leaf is Border2. Distance from Border1 and Border2 is the largest and
   longest distance in the Graph.

3. Because of Prerequisites the Border2->Border1 path is saved the middle of
   this path is the answer.
