1. Transfer array to the hash. To have a possibility to use word and a key, and check do a set of characters exists like a word in the array.  
2. Because we are able to use words multiple times this hash could be global.  
3. Now we able to run backward (**and moving forward too**) on the main string, and collect characters in a work comparing them with a hash. And calling the recursion on string without a word.
