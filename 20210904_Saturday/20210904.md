# Leetcode: 834. Sum of Distances in Tree.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/66e068c73aac39b7e458462daeeb679c

There is `n-1` edges because each node exept root has one edge to connect with a parent. 


**I think this reasoning has erros, because incorrect way to count edges.**

Return an array answer of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the sum of the distances between `i-th` node in the tree and all other nodes. So this is definately `DP` problem and value of `i` equal sum of children values + number of children.

- Create adjacency list based on two dimensional array.
- Create DP array filled with `nil` values.
- Create loop form `0` till `n-1` and call dfs function to fill curren node value, it this node is filled skip.

But we need to move in both directions so need to solve this problem twice from root to leafes and from leafes to root. And then sum both `DP` elemeting of current index to get answer element.
