# Leetcode: 268. Missing Number.

**Go: Two solutions. Boolean slice and sum.**

1. Use boolean slice size n+1, mark all elements from the input, search
   unmarked index.
2. Use Arithmetic progression sum, delete elements from the input, rest is the
   answer. (I got hint from the [mingjun's](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/discuss/69786/3-different-ideas%3A-XOR-SUM-Binary-Search.-Java-code) post.)

Go code (Using slice):

package main

func missingNumber(nums []int) int {
	tmp := make([]bool, len(nums)+1)
	for _, v := range nums {
		tmp[v] = true
	}
	for i, v := range tmp {
		if !v {
			return i
		}
	}
	panic("Unreachable.")
}
```

Go code (Using sum):

package main

func missingNumber(nums []int) int {
	l := len(nums)
	sum := (l * (l + 1)) / 2
	for _, v := range nums {
		sum -= v

	return sum
}
```
