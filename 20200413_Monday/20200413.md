##### [Leetcode: 645. Set Mismatch.](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-mismatch/)

```
# Ruby code
def find_error_nums(nums)
    sum = nums.sum
    uniq = nums.uniq.sum
    ideal = (1+nums.size)*nums.size/2
    [sum - uniq, ideal - uniq]
end
```

Array `nums` size is equal to the size of range from `1..nums.size`, but this array is shuffled, and maxumum value may be substitute by dublicate. But the mauxmum value that suppose to be in this array is `nums.size`. This property gives way to calculate `sum` of elements in ideal case it will be [Arithmetic progression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression).  
```
ideal = (1+nums.size)*num.size/2
```
Here we calculate the ideal sum of this sequence by `O(1)` without iteration over elements. Next task is to get sum of uniq elements, and actual sum of the array. To find dublicated value need to subtract **unic sum** from **actual_sum**, this way all nondublicated elements will be taken away.

```
dublicate = actual_sum - uniq_sum
```

To get substutute value need to substract **uniq sum** from **ideal_sum**, this way only forgotten element will stay, eleement that listed in actual array would eliminate their counterparts in ideal array.

```
missing = ideal_sum - uniq_sum
```
