**Ruby: Array, amount as index, reach previous by a coin.**

Idea is that each position in the dp array is an amount, need to reach previous amount from current one by different coins. And select minimum number of coints from all these reaches.

Dp array: indices amounts of money, values number of different coins to create an amount.  
Technique name: Pull DP. Get info from previous solutions.
