- https://leetcode.com/problems/design-a-food-rating-system/discuss/4417602/Go%3A-A-Map-of-Heaps-and-a-Map-of-Pointers.

**Go: A Map of Heaps and a Map of Pointers.**

1. Here is a map of cuisins, a cuisine is a Heap or Priority Queue.

2. A cuisine map's Key is the name of a cousin, and a value is a heap of
   elements.

3. Also, there is a map of pointers.

4. Map of pointers has key - food, value - a pointer to heap element and a
   heap itself.

5. First fill heaps, then fill Map of pointers in a double loop, because of
   pointers (values of the Map of Heaps are pointers that changed during the
   filling process).

6. When calling update, find heap by a map of pointers and update it.

7. When getting top, just return food of the 0 index of an appropriate heap.
