**Ruby: Array of indices, two pointers.**


At first push all character indices into an array. Then crate to pointers: first at the beging at the index array it moves from left to right, second at the end of the index array in moves backwards. And in each iterations swap characters that under the inceces that stored in correspotins elements of the array referenced by the pointers.
