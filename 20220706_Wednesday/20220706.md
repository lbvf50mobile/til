**Ruby: One loop and two variables.**

Variable `a` previous value, variable `b` current value. On every interato of the loop, `a` becomes `b`, and `b` becomes sum of old `a` and old `b`. Also increase a counter on each iteration. Return `b`. Loop condition a counter is less than `n`.

Also have two condition in the begining of the method one for `0 == n` and second for `1 == n`, return 0 and 1 respectively.
