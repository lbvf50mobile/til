**Ruby: DFS, save, filter, find.**

Main Idea here need only to save paths for leafs, then select deepest ones, move back and find element that common for all paths.

```Ruby
# Leetcode: 1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :left, :right
#     def initialize(val = 0, left = nil, right = nil)
#         @val = val
#         @left = left
#         @right = right
#     end
# end
# @param {TreeNode} root
# @return {TreeNode}
def lca_deepest_leaves(root)
    
end
```
