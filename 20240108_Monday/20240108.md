# Leetcode: 938. Range Sum of BST.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/b5b9dcd4531f5da4dca057f36bfcc1bd

**Go: Recursive solution.**

- Move left if a current is bigger than the low. Otherwise all elements of left
  sub tree are smaller than low.
- Move right if a current is less than the hight. Otherwise all elements of
  the right sub tree are bigger than high.
