**Ruby: Simplest solution with flatten and sort.**

Just smplest solution.

Next need to work with [this solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/discuss/1547354/3-Different-Approaches-for-Interview-With-Comments).


Ruby code (1):
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/
# = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
# Accepted.
# Thanks God, Jesus Chirst!
# = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
# Runtime: 158 ms, faster than 73.68% of Ruby online submissions for Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix.
# Memory Usage: 216.9 MB, less than 10.53% of Ruby online submissions for Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix.
# @param {Integer[][]} matrix
# @param {Integer} k
# @return {Integer}
def kth_smallest(matrix, k)
  matrix.flatten.sort[k-1]
end
```

Second solution is to use Heap. MinHeap.

Ruby code (2):
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/
# = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
# Thanks God, Jesus Chirst!
# = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
# @param {Integer[][]} matrix
# @param {Integer} k
# @return {Integer}
# TLE.
def kth_smallest(matrix, k)
  @d = true
  heap = MaxHeap.new([])
  tmp = [] if @d
  matrix.each do |row|
    row.each do |cell|
      puts "cell = #{cell}" if @d
      if heap.size < k
        heap.push(cell)
        tmp.push(cell) if @d
        tmp.sort! if @d
        tmp.reverse! if @d
      elsif heap.max >= cell
        heap.pop
        heap.push(cell)
        tmp.pop if @d
        tmp.push(cell) if @d
        tmp.sort! if @d
        tmp.reverse! if @d
      end
      puts "heap = #{tmp.to_a.inspect}" if @d
    end
  end
  heap.max
end
```

Third solution. Binary Search.

  rows, cols = matrix.size, matrix[0].size
  lo, hi = matrix[0][0], matrix[rows-1][cols-1]
  while lo <= hi # Error was here.
    mid = lo + (hi-lo)/2
    count, maxNum = 0, lo
    (0...rows).each do |r|
      c = cols - 1
      while( c >=0 && matrix[r][c] > mid)
        c -= 1;
      end
      if  c >= 0
        count += (c+1)
        maxNum = [maxNum, matrix[r][c]].max
      else
        break
      end
    end
    if k == count
      return maxNum
    elsif count < k
      lo = mid + 1
    else
      hi = mid - 1
    end
  end
  return lo
end

```
Test.
