**Ruby: Reasoning while coding.**

First thing first here totally new list would be created so a head needed. Next thing need something called accumulator or basked for containing outstanding rank. Already three variables created accumulator, head, current. And a head would be returned.      

Now it's time for a loop, and loop would be working till l1 or l2 is not a nil, l1 or l2 if shortly. First need to get value from l1 and l2, it going to be it's values or 0 if this pointers already point at the end of a list. And need to have a sum of l1 and l2 values and accumulator, then will be new value created, and new accumulator.       

When new accumulator and value for a list is created it is time for check do need to put this value in a head of a list or create a new element. In this program this going to be achieved but checking **whether** curr nil or not.    

**Important**: need to not forget to move pointers.    

When loop is finished add one more node if a curr not equal to zero.
