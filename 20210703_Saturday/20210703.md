Idea is to create sliding window with k elements that is defined by sum of differences and last index of windows. Find minimum. And at the of the loop slice the window from array.

    sum = 0
    (0...k).each do |i|
        sum += a[i]
    end
    min = sum
    j = k-1
    
    (k...a.size).each do |i|
        sum -= a[i-k]
        sum += a[i]
        if sum < min
            min = sum
            j = i
        end
        # p [i,sum]
    end
    # p a
    # p arr
    arr[j-k+1..j]
end
```
