**Ruby: DP DFS.**

1. Create hash-map with key lengh of the word a value is a word itself.
2. Create adjacency list for each word in a hash-map, a word is key and value is
   an array of predecessors.
3. Create a DFS with memoization of the graph described by the adjacency list from
   the step 2.
4. Start DFS for each word from an array.
5. Return maximum from the step four loop.
