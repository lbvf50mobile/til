**Ruby: Sliding window of a static size.**

If take all k elements from the right side, value would be total sum minus numbe of removed elements it is obvious. Next. If take one element from the left side from the right side `k-1` would be taken. So the value of removed elements is always `k` and number of elmenets that are preserved is `size-k`. And preserved elements are flow from the left part, to the right border of the array. In case when first `0 left k right`, `1 left k-1 right`, `2 left k-2 right` and so on.

Thus, bunch of remined elements  is a sliding window of a static size `size-k`. Thats float from the left to the right. Step by step. And it sum could be calculated by adding new element and removed just passed from the left side.

And the sum of reminded elements is total sum minus sliding window sum.

Let's try.
