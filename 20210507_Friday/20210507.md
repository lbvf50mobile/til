**Ruby: Check and reset on 1, increase on 0.**

Skip leading zeros and first one. Set counter to 0, on further ones check does counter less than k for interupt and reset counter, when zero increase counter.
Be aware of strings consisted only from zeros in a frist skipping loop. General scheme of the program return false in a loop if the condition is breaked, return true at the end of the loop.
