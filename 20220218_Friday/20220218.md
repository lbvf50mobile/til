**Ruby: Increasing monotonic stack. The left digit is most significant.**

`10` is bigger than `9`, `100` is bigger than `99`. More left elements have more influence on the size of the resulting number, so need to get rid of the biggest elements from the left. The array of digits must be increasing.

Let's try.

P.S. Before solving this task I had plenty of doubts [solution by Pingo](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/discuss/88678/Two-algorithms-with-detailed-explaination) resolve all of them. Really appreciate for this solution.

  n.each do |x|
