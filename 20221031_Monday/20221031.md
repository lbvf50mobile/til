# Leetcode: 766. Toeplitz Matrix.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/toeplitz-matrix/discuss/2764136/RubyGo%3A-Diagonals-start-at-first-column-and-first-row.

**Ruby/Go: Diagonals start at first column and first row.**

- Left-Top to Bottom-Right diagonals start at the first row and first col.
- Check all diagonals that start at the first col and row.
- Diagonal check it is a loop where row and diagonal increased on every step.
- To check that all elements are the same used variable prev, that intially has an unused value. At the first iteration this value substituted by value of top of the diagonal.
- If all diagonals do not interupt with false: when current value not equal to previous. Return true.

P.S. Main diagnoal checked twice. It could be optimized if start from the second element (index 1) a the first column.
