**Ruby: Reverse, multiply power 26, add.**

Ok. Let's think. For simplicity reduce the number of characters to two.  

A - 1  
B - 2  
AA - 3  
AB - 4  
BA - 5
BB - 6

Here is no zero.
A - 1  
Ax - 2  
Bx - 4  

Need to multiply by a power of alphabet size, where the power is an index of the reversed array.
