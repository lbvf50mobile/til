Fill an array composed from -1 by current maximum value from the input moving backward. Create a new array with size of input one, initialize it with minus one values, define max variable initiated to nil firstly. Start moving backward by indices, if max variable is not nil, save it value at current index on newly created array. Calculate max variable for current index at the input value. Return modified array that been created when loop is finished.

Because minimum value of an input array is 1 and -1 is a value for modified array when there is no max elements at the right side, it is easy to solve this task in one loop and one variable that initiated as -1. Just loop the array indexes backward and calculate next maximum based on current value (select maximum value from two values), substituting curren value with a current maximum and at the end of an iteration set current maximum equal to the next one.  Change array in place by one pass.
