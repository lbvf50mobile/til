Fill an array composed from -1 by current maximum value from the input moving backward. Create a new array with size of input one, initialize it with minus one values, define max variable initiated to nil firstly. Start moving backward by indices, if max variable is not nil, save it value at current index on newly created array. Calculate max variable for current index at the input value. Return modified array that been created when loop is finished.
