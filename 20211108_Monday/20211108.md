**Ruby: Number of trees in a range.**


Need to create DP algorithm where the subproblem is number of trees in a range. The key idea that tree can be represtented as left range, root node, right range. And one more there alway only one nil. So the formula of number of possible trees for a root node is `dp(left_range)*dp(right_range)`. Thats all.

  track(1,n)

  total = 0
  (i..j).each do |k|
    total += track(i,k-1) *  track(k+1,j) 
  end
  @dp[i][j] = total
