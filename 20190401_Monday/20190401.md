## CrosswordFomation

You're a crossword fanatic, and have finally decided to try and creat your own. However, you also love symmetry and good design, so you come up with a set of rules they should flollow:

- the crossword must contain exactly four words;
- these four words should from four pairwise insertions;
- all words must be written either left-to-right of top-to-bottom;
- the area of the area of the rectange lormed by empty cells inside the intersections isn't equal to zero.

Given 4 words, find the number of ways to make a crossword following the above-described rules. Note that two crosswords which  differ by rotation are considered different.

Forgot the 4th rule - has to have a non-zero square in the middle. That ate up a lo of time - reat through my code multiple times. All hidden past with first submit.

Managed with giving it 24 permutation and 6 nested loops with constrains ans "continues"s, to not go deeper whtn the previews match fails. Happy with mine :)

For anyone running up agains execution time limits on test 12 and working in a String is different from
an array of charachtrs, try to converting input into an array of an array of characters. String operation are expensive.
