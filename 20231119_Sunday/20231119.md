**Ruby/Go: Sort keys descending and compute current amount of maximum values.**

1. Create an Counter structure, indices values of the input array, values
   amount of occurrences. 
2. Find minimum value of the input array. 
3. From a Counter create array of pairs value/amount but without a minimum
   one. 4. Sort array by index Descending! It is important! 
5. Iterate over the array compute current amount of maximum values, accumulate
   the answer.

Here are two keys: 
1. Current max value amount always extended by previous max value. 
2. It is important to move from the biggest index of a Counter to  the
   smallest because:

```
[5:1; 2:50, 1:100]
```
Prev_max | Total_max | Answer 
--- | --- | ---
0 | (0+1) = 1 | (0+1) = 1 
1 | (1+50) = 51 | (1+51) = 52

Ans: 52

```
[2:50, 5:1, 1:100]
```
Prev_max | Total_max | Answer
--- | --- | ---
0 | (0+50) = 50 | (0+50) = 50
50 | (50+1) = 51 | (50+51) = 101

Ans: 101 Incorrect!

Priority is important. Because it is not a simple prefix sum. Here is a
"double adding". If for Total_max there is no need for priority, for answer it
is important.

Language | Runtime | Memory
--- | --- | --- 
Ruby | 339 ms | 229.2 MB
Golang | 694 ms | 15.1 MB

P.S. Loosk like there are different test sets for different languages.
