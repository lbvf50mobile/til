**Ruby: Three conditions.**

- Count all capital letters.
- Return `true` if number is `0` or `string.size`.
- Return `true` if a number of capital letters are `size-1` and a first letter is capital.
- Return `false` at the end of the method, if none of the above conditions is true.

**Note:** Error was in mismatching `==` with `=`.
