# Leetcode: 718. Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray.

**Ruby: Let's try DP.**

What do I get from the Hint `dp[i][j]` will be answer for inputs `A[i:]` and `B[j:]`. What can I get from this Hint?
- `dp` array has `nums1.size` rows.
- `dp` array has `nums2.size` columns.

Because size of each array is less or equal to 1000 it is possible to try recursion solution.
And if take a look on recursion. If `A[i]` == `B[j]` then return `1 + rec(i+1,j+1)`.

Looks like it going be TLE because complexity is `O(M*N)`. But at least it going to return correct answer.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 718. Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-repeated-subarray/
# @param {Integer[]} nums1
# @param {Integer[]} nums2
# @return {Integer}
# TLE.
def find_length(nums1, nums2)
  @n1, @n2 = nums1, nums2
  @dp = Array.new(nums1.size).map{ Array.new(nums2.size)}
  @max = 0
  (0...nums1.size).each do |i|
    (0...nums2.size).each do |j|
      next if @dp[i][j]
      rec(i,j)
    end
  end
  @max
end

def rec(i,j)
  return 0 if ! (i.between?(0,@n1.size-1) && j.between?(0,@n2.size-1))
  return @dp[i][j] if @dp[i][j]
  if @n1[i] != @n2[j]
    @dp[i][j] = 0
  else
    @dp[i][j] = 1 + rec(i+1, j+1)
  end
  @max = @dp[i][j] if @dp[i][j] > @max
  return @dp[i][j]
end

```
