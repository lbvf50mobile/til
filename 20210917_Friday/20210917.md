**Ruby: Firs array counter increase, second one decrease.**

There are only 1001 different elements could be stored in the arrays of this task. Numbers from 0 till 1000. That means it is possible to create a counter how many times each element appears in an array. Interating over the first array counter increased, interating over scecond array each time an element met and counter is larger then zero element inserted into tha answer array and element's counter decireased. Thus only elements that appears in both arrays would be inserted in the answer array and amount of each element will be minum from apears in first and second arrays. Thank you.
