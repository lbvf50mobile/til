Here I found that when heapify after `pop`, when moving head down, it's possible to check left, thatn check rigth, with swaping, and than rember last descendand to swap. That's simplify a code.

```
        while i*2 < @a.size || i*2+1 < @a.size 
            left = i*2
            right = i*2+1
            next_i = i
            if @a[left] && @a[i] > @a[left]
                @a[i],@a[left] = @a[left],@a[i]
                next_i = left
            end
            if @a[right] && @a[i] > @a[right]
                @a[i],@a[right] = @a[right],@a[i]
                next_i = right
            end
            break if i == next_i
            i = next_i
        end
```
