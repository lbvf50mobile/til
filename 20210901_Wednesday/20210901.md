# Leetcode: 565. Array Nesting.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/85ea9ed5f39111092a065b69a5c23e73


I still have a plenty of question that is not clear or fully clear for me:

- Why loop happens only when `j == nums[i]`, could not it happens that we send some where and it's loops there? (ques not because as we send there, this point is not occupyed by it's own index. But why all loops finish only on `nums[i]`?)
- When visited set only after moving in second loop?

  ans = 0
  visited = {}
  (0...nums.size).each do |i|
    next if visited[i]
    count = 0
    j = nums[i]
    while true
      j = nums[j]
      visited[j] = true
      count +=1
      break if j == nums[i]
    end
    ans = count if count > ans
  end
  ans
end
```
