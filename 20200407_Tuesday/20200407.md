- https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/discuss/567986/Ruby.-Explanation.

- Select the root from two nodes.
- If both nodes are nil, return nil.
- Calculate value for the root.
- Recursive call to set root and value for left subtree.
- Recursive call to set root and value for right subtree.
