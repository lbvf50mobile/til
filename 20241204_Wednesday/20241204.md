For better understanding, the task needs to be flipped. Instead of searching
for some characters in str1, it should be stated that for each character in
str2, there must be a corresponding character in str1 in preserved order. This
makes the task much easier.

The process involves iterating over all characters in str2 and finding the
corresponding ones in str1. If the current character in str1 does not fit the
rule, the next character in str1 will be checked until a satisfying character
is found. If there are no such characters in str1, the function will return
false. To match characters from str1 to str2, the character code in str1 needs
to be increased; however, to match characters from str2 to str1, the character
code in str2 needs to be decreased. To implement a match between the two
strings, the characters must be equal, or one character from a pair must be
modified.

The program uses a nested loop: the outer loop iterates over all elements in
str2, while the inner loop finds the appropriate character in str1. The inner
loop saves the index where it stops. Before the inner loop, there is a flag
that indicates whether a matching pair has been found. If the flag is not set
after the loop, the function will return false. When the outer loop is
finished, the function will return true.
