This solution is simple.

1. Sort box array by units decrasing.
2. Iterate over it, and fill truck with big boxes until counting number of units.

But most important part of this soluting is an error I made and spend time for debugging: Errorprone name for answer, I call it units as like as a loop variable. Always need to have an `answer` in the answer variable to avoid such kind of debbuging.

def maximum_units(box_types, truck_size)
  box_types = box_types.sort_by{|x| - x.last}
  p box_types
  units1 = 0 # ! Variables name confilct! Which leads to debbuging.
  box_types.each do |amount, units|
    p [amount, units, truck_size]
    if truck_size > 0
      if amount < truck_size
        units1 += (amount * units)
        truck_size -= amount
      else
        units1 += (truck_size * units)
        truck_size = 0
      end
    end
    p units1
  end
  units1
end
```
