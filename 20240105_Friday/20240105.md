**Go: BinarySearch. DBabichev's solution.**

This code is a translaton of the DBabichev's [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/discuss/667975/Python-3-Lines-dp-with-binary-search-explained).

P.S. I do not find a DP here, it is an array that updated during the
algorithm. There is no any address of a subproblem, and there is no sub
problems to get data from. In such way every algorithm with an array could be
called a DP, Monothonic Stack for example. Also, this algorithm is looked like
a version of a Monothonic Stack.
