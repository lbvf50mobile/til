Idea in this task is to `k` times invert minimum value of an array. If this value is negative a benefit will be maximum. If this value is positive damage will be minimum.

Ruby code: 
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 1005. Maximize Sum Of Array After K Negations.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-sum-of-array-after-k-negations/
# Runtime: 180 ms, faster than 14.29% of Ruby online submissions for Maximize Sum Of Array After K Negations.
# Memory Usage: 9.9 MB, less than 33.33% of Ruby online submissions for Maximize Sum Of Array After K Negations.
# @param {Integer[]} a
# @param {Integer} k
# @return {Integer}
def largest_sum_after_k_negations(a, k)
    a.sort!
    k.times{ a[0] = - a[0]; a.sort!}
    a.sum
end
```

If array is sorted, after changing sign of element `i` if it becomes bigger than `i+1`, the smallest element in array becomes element under index `i+1`. Thus algorithm could be improved.

    a.sort!
    i = 0
    k.times{ 
        a[i] = - a[i] 
        i += 1 if i < a.size - 1 && a[i] > a[i+1]
    }
    a.sum
end
