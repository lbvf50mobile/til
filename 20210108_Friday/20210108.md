# Leetcode: 1504. Count Submatrices With All Ones.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/ed0d8bb7035a060949a64bebf0b92ab5


Using sliding window to count all squared in one row. Also have an idea to store widest and highest parallelogram that has it right bottom corner at the matrix square for future development of this task. To solve this task for several rows.
