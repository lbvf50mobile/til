# Leetcode: 35. Search Insert Position.

**Ruby: Just a Binary Search with a condition at the end.**

**Note:** code works, but needs some more investigation in the description, description is a draft. 

If target exists in an array it is a just Binary Search solution, but if there is no target in array wait while `l` becomes greater then `r`. Return `l` if  `nums[l] > target` and `l+1` if `nums[l] < target`. 

Some image to rember smaller value displaces bigger one, it pushes bigger one up to a highter altitude.
