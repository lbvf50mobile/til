**Ruby: Just a Binary Search with a condition at the end.**


If a target is in the array just return its index. If there is no target in the array return position of the first element that's bigger than the target. If there are no such elements of a new element appended to the array.

Inserting a new element it's like shifting right all bigger elements.
