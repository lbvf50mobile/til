**Ruby/Go: Ruby kanwei/algorithms are too slow.**

It is already normal result when [kanwei/algorithms/Containers/MinHeap](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/kanwei/algorithms/Containers/MinHeap) brings TLE on valid solutions.

Ruby code:

# TLE.
# I treat TLE as a normal result when working with Containers::MinHeap in
