**Ruby: Sort, find middle, sum of subtractions.**

1. Sort array.
2. Take middle element if arrays size is odd, take average of two middle elements if the size is even.
3. Sum of absolute value of differense between each element in the array and value from the step 2.

The code is based on [The-Mavericks solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements-ii/discuss/2216211/Median-better-than-average!-Developing-intution).
