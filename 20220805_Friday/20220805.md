**Ruby: Array of positions. Coin change.**

It is a Push DP solution. Create an array for each sum starting from zero til `target`. There is only one way to reach `0` and further iterate over elements (coins): adding a coin to current position is a addres, value of current position is a number to increase value of the address.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby

def combination_sum4(nums, target)
  dp = Array.new(target+1,0)
  dp[0] = 1 # Only one way to create sum 0.
  nums = nums.sort
  # Iterate ovel all positions.
  (0...dp.size).each do |i|
    curr = dp[i] # Number of ways to reach current position.
    next if 0 == curr # no need to iterate from unreachable position.
    nums.each do |coin| # Iterate over all possible coins.
      addr = i + coin
      break if addr > target 
      dp[addr] += curr
    end
  end
  dp[target]
end
```
