**Ruby: Iterative inorder traversal.**

Start reasoning:  
 
1. Flow goes from right to left. The most right point has it own value.
2. Move right till the end. Push nodes in stack.
3. When no where to go pop node set new value, save it in a sum variable.
4. If new value has a left pointer, go left.
5. Loop, stack, sum variable all what to need for this task.

It is an iterative inorder traversal.

Let's try.

During the coding I step from the initial reasoning.

Ruby code:

def convert_bst(root)
  return root if root.nil?
  stack = [root]
  sum = 0
  while ! stack.empty?
    # Move right as far as possible.
    while stack.last.right
      stack.push(stack.last.right)
    end
    # When there is no way rigth.
    # Try to find way left.
    while ! stack.empty?
      # Because of pop. Can't got rigth same way.
      node = stack.pop  
      sum += node.val
      node.val = sum
      if node.left
        stack.push(node.left)
        break
      end
    end
  end
  root
end

```
