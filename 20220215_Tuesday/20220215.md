**Ruby: x xor x = 0; 0 xor x = x;**

This task is based on the rule that `x xor x = 0` and `0 xor x = x`. Because there is only one unique number and set of pairs in the input, all pairs would be 0, and 0 xor unique number would be that unique number.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 136. Single Number.

def single_number(nums)
  nums.reduce(&:^)
end
```
