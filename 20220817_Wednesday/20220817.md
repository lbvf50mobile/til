**Ruby: Word to Code, Words to Codes, Uniq, size.**

Write a method to convert word to the code. Then map all array to codes. Call `uniq` method and return the size of the array.

Let's try.


Ruby code:
```Ruby

  @map = [".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
  words.map{|x| word2morse(x)}.uniq.size
end

def word2morse(word)
  word.chars.map{|x| @map[x.ord - ?a.ord]}.join
