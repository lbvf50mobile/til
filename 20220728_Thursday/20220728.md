**Ruby: Create counter of chars and compare it for both words.**

Create an array where char represented as and index, in increase appropriate index every time a char meet. Compare these arrays for both words.

Let's try.

Ruby code:

def is_anagram(s, t)
  return false if s.size != t.size
  create_map(s) == create_map(t)
end

def create_map(str)
  ans = Array.new(28,0)
  str.chars.each do |c|
    ans[c.ord - ?a.ord] += 1
  end
  ans
end
