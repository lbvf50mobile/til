**Ruby: Split, convert, count.**

In this task important condition is remove leading zeros, this happens automatically in Ruby when convert string to an integer. First substitute consecutive non digits by one space bar, then split by space bar. After splitting convert array elements from string to integers - thus removing leading zeros, leave only unique elements in the array and return array size.
