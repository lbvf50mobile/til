**Ruby: Pull DP.**

https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/discuss/71495/An-easy-understanding-DP-solution-in-Java - solution based on this one. Really appreciate Karci for this solution.

Two loops. First one fill values from 0..n, second one for current n find minimum in `dp[n- i*i] + 1` when `n - i*i >0 && i >= 1`. Let's try.

Ruby code:

def num_squares(n)
  dp = Array.new(n+1,0)
  dp[0] = 0
  (1..n).each do |num|
    min = dp[num-1] + 1
    (2...num).each do |i|
      arg = num - (i*i)
      break if arg < 0
      value = dp[arg] + 1
      min = value if value < min
    end
    dp[num] = min
  end
  dp[n]
    
end
```
