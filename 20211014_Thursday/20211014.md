**Ruby: Pull DP.**

https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/discuss/71495/An-easy-understanding-DP-solution-in-Java - solution based on this one. Really appreciate Karci for this solution.

Two loops. First one fill values from 0..n, second one for current n find minimum in `dp[n- i*i] + 1` when `n - i*i >0 && i >= 1`. Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 279. Perfect Squares.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/
# based on:
# https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/discuss/71495/An-easy-understanding-DP-solution-in-Java
# @param {Integer} n
# @return {Integer}
def num_squares(n)
    
end
```
