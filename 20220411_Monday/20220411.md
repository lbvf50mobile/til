**Ruby: Multiple call of shift by one.**

- `grid[i][n-1]` it is a last in row. Last column.
- `grid[m-1][n-1]` it is the ...

Ok. But it is possible just iterate over all elements in folded loop, and set current `grid[i][j]` to the value from the previos iteration. At the begining initiate previous as `grid[m-1][n-1]`. It is if `k == 1`.

Let's try to fire shift by on k times. And if this aglorithm would not pass explore for further optimization.

Optimization: There `n*m` elements in a grid, if `k == n*m` there is no change in a grid. If `k` is bigger than `n*m` need to shift by reminer of quotient `k` by `n*m` that could be retrieved by the modulo operation.
