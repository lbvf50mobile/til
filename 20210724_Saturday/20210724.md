# Leetcode: 126. Word Ladder II.

Going to solve this problem by DP. Calculate for each element of an array minimal amount of jumps till EndWord. First check do EndWord exists in an array, then calculate amount of steps for each word. Generating this kind of array and also next element to jump.  So I need 2 arrays array with number of jumps, and array with next element. And how to avoid circularityes? This is interesting. Maybe start from last word first mart all that have one jump, then all that have 2 jumps, then all that has 3 jumps?

And what if use BFS. And fill this array parent and number of steps. 

Idea is: 

1) Check for Ee array.  
2) Implemen BFS and fill tow arrays deepnes and parten.  
3) Iterate over all words that has 1 step from StartWord and select one with minumu amount of steps.  
4) If there are no such word return empty list.  
5) If there are such word create answer list.  

For BFS need to create adjacency list.
