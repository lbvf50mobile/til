**Ruby/Go: Move corner of first image over second one.**

Idea is to move upper-left corner of first image over all cells of second image.
Then move bottom right corner of second image over all cells of second image.

During this moving count ovelaped ones.

Need to pass new coordinat of upper-left corner on the second image to start count overlaping. The same is for bottom-right corter.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
```

Tests:
```
[[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,1,0]]
[[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]]
[[1]]
[[1]]
[[0]]
[[0]]
[[0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0]]
[[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0,0]]
[[0,1],[0,0]]
[[0,0],[1,0]]
```
