There is an ambiguity when single digit codes, are two single digits are start of multi symbols code or it is pair of codes? So to eliminate this ambiguity first substitute multi symbol codes by characters, and then substitute each symbol by characters. Regex with digits enclosed in parentheses is used for selecting subject for substitution in both cases. At the Ruby method gsub each group in parentheses stored in separate variable with name equal to dollar prefixed number of open bracket for this group in a Regex statement. So it is easy to extract number from this variable and convert it to ASCII code of a symbol and acquire symbol by code.
