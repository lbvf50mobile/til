# Some tests.

Given an integer n and an array a of length n, your task is to apply the following mutation to a:

Array a mutates into a new array b of length n.
For each i from 0 to n - 1, b[i] = a[i - 1] + a[i] + a[i + 1].
If some element in the sum a[i - 1] + a[i] + a[i + 1] does not exist, it should be set to 0. For example, b[0] should be equal to 0 + a[0] + a[1].
Example

For n = 5 and a = [4, 0, 1, -2, 3], the output should be mutateTheArray(n, a) = [4, 5, -1, 2, 1].

b[0] = 0 + a[0] + a[1] = 0 + 4 + 0 = 4
b[1] = a[0] + a[1] + a[2] = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5
b[2] = a[1] + a[2] + a[3] = 0 + 1 + (-2) = -1
b[3] = a[2] + a[3] + a[4] = 1 + (-2) + 3 = 2
b[4] = a[3] + a[4] + 0 = (-2) + 3 + 0 = 1
So, the resulting array after the mutation will be [4, 5, -1, 2, 1].

```Ruby
def mutateTheArray(n, a)
    prv = 0
    (0...a.size).each do |i|
        tmp = a[i]
        nxt = i < a.size - 1 ? a[i+1] : 0
        a[i] += prv + nxt
        prv = tmp
    end
    a
end
```

You are given an array of integers a. A new array b is generated by rearranging the elements of a in the following way:

b[0] is equal to a[0];
b[1] is equal to the last element of a;
b[2] is equal to a[1];
b[3] is equal to the second-last element of a;
and so on.
Your task is to determine whether the new array b is sorted in strictly ascending order or not.

Example

For a = [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2], the output should be alternatingSort(a) = true.

The new array b will look like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], which is in strictly ascending order, so the answer is true.

For a = [1, 4, 5, 6, 3], the output should be alternatingSort(a) = false.

The new array b will look like [1, 3, 4, 6, 5], which is not in strictly ascending order, so the answer is false.

```Ruby
def alternatingSort(a)
    b = []
    i = 0
    j = a.size-1
    (0...a.size).each do |x|
        if x.even?
            b.push(a[i])
            i += 1
        else
            b.push(a[j])
            j -= 1
        end
    end
    (1...b.size).each do |x|
        return false if b[x-1] >= b[x]
    end
    true
end
```

You are implementing your own programming language and you've decided to add support for merging strings. A typical merge function would take two strings s1 and s2, and return the lexicographically smallest result that can be obtained by placing the symbols of s2 between the symbols of s1 in such a way that maintains the relative order of the characters in each string.

For example, if s1 = "super" and s2 = "tower", the result should be merge(s1, s2) = "stouperwer".

```Ruby
def mergeStrings(s1, s2)
    h1 = s1.chars.each_with_object(Hash.new){|x,h| h[x] ||= 0; h[x] += 1}
    h2 = s2.chars.each_with_object(Hash.new){|x,h| h[x] ||= 0; h[x] += 1}
    s1 = s1.chars
    s2 = s2.chars
    ans = ""
    while (!s1.empty?) || (!s2.empty?)
        if s1.empty?
          x = s2.shift
          ans += x
          next
        end
        if s2.empty?
            x = s1.shift
            ans += x
            next
        end
        x1 = s1.first
        x2 = s2.first
        if h1[x1] == h2[x2]
            if x1 < x2
                s1.shift
                ans += x1
            elsif x1 > x2
                s2.shift
                ans += x2
            else
                s1.shift
                ans += x1
            end
            next
        end
        if h1[x1] < h2[x2]
            s1.shift
            ans += x1
            next
        end
        s2.shift
        ans += x2
    end
    ans 
end

Given an array of positive integers a, your task is to calculate the sum of every possible a[i] ∘ a[j], where a[i] ∘ a[j] is the concatenation of the string representations of a[i] and a[j] respectively.

Example

For a = [10, 2], the output should be concatenationsSum(a) = 1344.

a[0] ∘ a[0] = 10 ∘ 10 = 1010,
a[0] ∘ a[1] = 10 ∘ 2 = 102,
a[1] ∘ a[0] = 2 ∘ 10 = 210,
a[1] ∘ a[1] = 2 ∘ 2 = 22.
So the sum is equal to 1010 + 102 + 210 + 22 = 1344.

For a = [8], the output should be concatenationsSum(a) = 88.

There is only one number in a, and a[0] ∘ a[0] = 8 ∘ 8 = 88, so the answer is 88.

```Ruby
def concatenationsSum(a)
    x = a.sum
    y = a.sum{|x| 10**(Math.log10(x).to_i + 1)}
    a.sum{|z| z*y + x}
end
```
