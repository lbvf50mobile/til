- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/4ba5c42ce4ffeeb6904b7f01bd58c4e6

**Ruby: Count colors, fill numbers in the array.**


There only 3 colors: 0,1,2. Fill array with numbers of every color matches.

- Fill zeroz: from 0 till a[0] not incluive.
- Fill ones: from a[0] till a[0]+a[1] not inclusive.
- Fill twos: from a[0]+a[1] till the end.

Let's try.
