**Go: Pull DP, Push DP, Recursion.**

Several kinds of solutions for the Climbing Stairs problem.

1. Pull DP.
2. Push DP.
3. Pull DP with three variables.
4. Pull DP with two variables.
5. Recursion.

Go code Pull DP:
```Go

package main

func climbStairs(n int) int {
	// Pull DP.
	// Add two stairs 0 and -1.
	amount := n + 2
	dp := make([]int, amount)
	dp[0], dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 1, 1
	// But diff is 1.
	// -1 => 0;
	// 0 => 1;
	// 1 => 2;
	// 2 => 3;
	// Starting from 2;
	for i := 3; i < amount; i += 1 {
		dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
	}
	return dp[amount-1]
}
```
Go code Push DP:
```Go

package main

func climbStairs(n int) int {
	// Push DP.
	// Starting from zero.
	// amount is n+1+2 for throw.
	amount := n + 3
	dp := make([]int, amount)
	dp[0] = 1
	for i := 0; i <= n; i += 1 {
		dp[i+1] += dp[i]
		dp[i+2] += dp[i]
	}
	return dp[n]
}
```
Go code Pull DP 3 vars:
```Go

	// Pull DP 3 vars.
	if 1 == n {

	a, b, c := 1, 2, 0
	for i := 3; i <= n; i += 1 {
		c = a + b
		a, b = b, c
	}
	return c
}
```
Go code Pull Dp 2 vars:
```Go

	}
	a, b := 1, 2
	for i := 3; i <= n; i += 1 {
		a, b = b, a+b
	}
	return b
}
```
Go code Recursive:
```Go

func rec(n int) int {
	if 1 == n {

	if 0 != mem[n] {

	ans := rec(n-1) + rec(n-2)
	mem[n] = ans
