- https://leetcode.com/problems/projection-area-of-3d-shapes/discuss/697014/Ruby-solution-with-Arraytranspose.

Solution is sum of three projections.

- XY - bottom projection, it is number of towers. Count all elements, but do not count holes, elements equal to zero.
- XZ - View along the rows. Area is sum of maximal elements in rows.
- YZ - View along the columns. Area is sum of maximal elements it columns.

To get XY area just flatten the array and count number of element that greater then zero. To calculate XZ area map each row to it maximal value and get sum of these values. To calculate YZ area need to transpose matrix, make columns to be a rows, then act like in XZ - map to maximal values, get sum of them.  And return sum of all three areas.
