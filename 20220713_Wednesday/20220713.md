**Ruby: DFS as simple and fast as possible.**

Only five munutes for coding. DFS method gets node and level, extends answer array if needed, push value in appropriate level array.

Let's try.

My bug: First time I push new value always at the end of the answer array, need to push into the level's index.

Ruby code:

# Definition for a binary tree node.

def level_order(root)
  @answer = []
  dfs(root, 0)
  @answer
end

def dfs(node, level)
  return if node.nil?
  @answer.push([]) if @answer.size == level
  @answer[level].push(node.val)
  dfs(node.left, level+1)
  dfs(node.right, level+1)
end
```
