Create associative array histogram where keys are values from the array, and under this keys number of appearance in this array stored. Invert this associative array so keys become values and return value stored under half of the input size key.

def repeated_n_times(a)
    a.each_with_object(Hash.new){|v,obj| obj[v] ||= 0; obj[v] += 1}.invert[a.size/2]
end
```

##### Return on second appearance.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/n-repeated-element-in-size-2n-array/discuss/730798/Ruby-solution.-Return-value-if-it-appears-twice.

Only one number in an array will be repeated more then ones, it is a value with N duplicates. So there is not need to loop over all array. It's possible to return value as soon as it appears twice. Appearance tracking implemented by Hash where a values are keys. If current value is a key of the Hash time to return it. If not add new key to the hash.
