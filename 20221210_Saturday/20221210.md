**Ruby/Go: Total sum and array of sub tree's sums.**

Time: O(n); Memory: O(n);

Everey node delivers two ways to split a tree with two values.

1. (total_sum - left_subtree_sum) * left_subtree_sum;
2. (total_sum - right_subtree_sum) * right_subtree_sum;

Calculate total_sum and create of array where stored left and right subtree's sums. By a loop find maximum value.
