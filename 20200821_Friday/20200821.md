**Double hash solution. One for histogram second for used numbers in than histogram**

To return `true` in this task need to be sure that numbers of repeats of each number of array is uniq. Or that all columns of histogram have different height. 

- First create histogram by hash, keys number from the array, values count of occurrence of this number.
- Get values from this hash. And create new new hash that stores numbers that meet during iterate over array.
- If during iteration of the values array meet number that marked as used, return false.
- When loop over values array is finished return true, all elements of input arrays occurred different times.
