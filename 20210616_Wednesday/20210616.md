**Ruby: Regex based solution.**

String must start from three elements, white spaces, sign, digits, if not return zero. Sign and digets must be separated in the return match object that why they are surrounded by paranthesis in the regex. Next, check for borders if number is too positive/negatie big (out of the borders). Atthe last step I made en error and to big number reduced to `2**31`, but it should be `2**31 -1`. The Lesson is need to spend more time on corner cases. That's it. Thank you for reading.
