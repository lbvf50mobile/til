`.` is an alias for `source` in Bash: https://ss64.com/bash/source.html

```shell
Read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context.

Syntax
      . filename [arguments]

      source filename [arguments]
source is a synonym for dot/period '.' in bash, but not in POSIX sh, so for maximum compatibility use the period.
