Create Date object that stored first day of an input year, transform input string into date object. Increase date in "first day object" by one day, until both objects store same date. On each increasing increment counter, that initially equal to one. Return value of counter.  In Ruby it is easy to change date just [adding numeric value of days](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.1/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html#method-i-2B) to a date object.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/day-of-the-year/discuss/797453/Ruby-solution%3A-sum-of-elements-in-slice-of-array-plus-day-from-an-input.

Create an array amounts of days in a month with zero element at the beginning, to be able get number of days by 1 based index of a month. Initially in the array declaration February set to 29, set February to 29 if a year is leap. Return sum of range elements of the array from 0 to passed month exclusively, month does not included, plus a day extracted from passed date.
