**Ruby/Go: Paint in to colors.**

Really appreciate [Akash Anup](https://leetcode.com/akash3anup/) for his
[solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite/discuss/1484708/Python-or-BFS-Graph-Coloring-or-Simple-Solution).


Ok.

1. Crate an array of colors with 3 states: No color, Black, White.
2. Iterate over all nodes in a loop. Skip if a node is colored.
3. If node is not colored: Start BFS, color first node black.
4. If child has the same color return false. Otherwise pain child inverted
   color.
5.  Return true if reach the end of all loops.
