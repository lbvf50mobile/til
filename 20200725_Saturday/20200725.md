To make pair divisible by 60, sum of both reminders from division by 60 must either 0 or 60. Need to create hash that going store reminder as a key, and current amount of such reminders during loop over array.  Having current reminder it is possible to restore amount of required reminders from a hash using `60 - current_reminder` as a key - this value will be a number of pairs curren element could create with previous part of array. Also need to have a special branch for reminder equal to `0`.
