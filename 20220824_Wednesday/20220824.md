**Ruby: Multiply a variable by 3 and compare with an argument.**

Create a loop multiplying the value by 3 till the value is less or equal to `2**31`. Return true if an argument is equal to the value. Otherwice return false.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby

  return true if 1 == n
  border = (2**31) - 1
  value = 1
  while value <= border
    return true if value == n
    value *= 3
  end
  return false
end
```
