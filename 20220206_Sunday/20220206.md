**Ruby: Write Pointer and Read Pointer. Copy when Not a[wp-1] == a[wp] == a[rp].**

Start to generate an Algorithm from the situation when there are no duplications at all. Only unique values.
Let's there would be two pointers `Write Pointer` or `wr` that stands on the last write position.  
And a `Read Pointer` or `rp` that always run forward and read values, when some condition happens `wr` moves and data from the read pointer copied to a `wr` like this `a[wr+1] = a[rp]`.

When there are no duplicates allowed the write condition is `a[wr] != a[rp]`. And when there are allowed pairs of duplicates the condition would be **no duplicate pair and read pointer on the same element** or `!(a[wr-1] == a[wr] && a[wr] == a[rp])` if in the code representation. Also, it could be described as: if there are no three elements of the same value it is time to write. 

Let's try.

Ruby code:
