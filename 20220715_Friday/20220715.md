# Leetcode: 695. Max Area of Island.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/discuss/2286978/Ruby%3A-One-loop-and-one-BFS.

**Ruby: One loop and one BFS.**

Long story short. Connected componets. One loop over all cells. One method to iterate over connected components.

**Log:** 

- Time: 33 minutes.
- Errors:
  - Use @v instead of @g.
  - Add into the queue the same coordinates instad of new ones.
  - Incorrect BFS. Marked visited in wrong plase. Insade the loop. Need to mark visited just in time of adding.

**Summary:** 

Need to repeat even well known algorithms. Because in hurry could forget details. Most time spend on debugging, frist code written in 10 minutes.

Need more pracitce.
