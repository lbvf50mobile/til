**Ruby: Mark diagonal by i-j, (row-column) indicies.**


The code is based on the [solution of lee215](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-matrix-diagonally/discuss/489749/JavaPython-Straight-Forward).


1. Iterate over all cells, get diagonal hash by `row-column` indecies.
2. Push values of diagonals into a hash map.
3. Sort arrays in the hash map.
4. Iterate over all cells, pop values for appropriate diagonal.

Really appriciate Lee215 for `row-column` hash to mark a diagonal, it is really convinent way to point diagonal in a matrix.
