**Ruby: Seek for 3 elements Turbulent, grow, seek.**

Idea is that O(n) is to itereate over the array several times.

This fact used to instal minimum value of an answer. First set minimum size for 1 and iterate over array untill found `a[i]!=a[j]` this means: turbulent of size 2 appears.

Next. Create method that seek for 3 elements turbulent array starting from some index `i` inclusive and start to `grow`, if turbulent array fails, start to seek from the fails point.

General Idea:

1. Be sure there are more two elements burbulent array.
2. Start to seek 3 elements array. And increase it.
3. When increasing fails seek text 3 elements array.

Ok. Let's try to make the code.

Ruby code:

    if a[i] != a[i+1]

  i,j = borders
  while borders
    width = j - i + 1
    max = width if max < width
    # Is it possible to move j further?
    j0,j1,j2 = j-1,j,j+1
    if j2 < a.size && valid(j0,j1,j2)
      j = j2
    else
      borders = find_3_elements(j)
      break if ! borders
      i,j = borders
    end

  return true if @a[j0] > @a[j1] && @a[j1] < @a[j2]
  return false
end

def find_3_elements(i)
  false if i > @a.size - 3
  (i..@a.size-3).each do |j|
    return [j,j+2] if valid(j,j+1,j+2)
  end
  return false
end
