# Leetcode: 698. Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/d8f57cdbee0d93ea60796cf63e83abb0

At first sum must be divisible by k without reminder.

Second must be k elements each ... wait. I think this is backtacking where need to get subsum `q = sum/k` k times. 

That means there must be a counter than increased every time `q` is reached, if counter equal to `k` return.  

At the end of problem's function check do counter equal `k`. Let's try.
 
Ruby code:
```Ruby
