**Ruby: Two inorder traversal and merge two arrays.**


The first task is to write a LNR in-order traversal for the binary tree iteratively. How to implement it?  Move left and push in the stack till the `nil`. Then pop read value, and push right.

Ok, when it is possible push and move left. Set next_step to left.
When next_step is `nil`. Pop. Save value. Set next_step. The right pointer. 


Okey. With binary tree reading into the array it is done. Merging to arrays.
Three keys. Both full, first empty, second empty.
In case both are full pop from first if `first < second` otherwise pop from the second.
In one of the full cases just pop from a not empty one.

Let's try.

```
[2,1,4]
[1,0,3]
[1,null,8]
[8,1]
[]
[5,1,7,0,2]
```
