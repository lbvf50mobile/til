**Ruby: Loop and buffer.**

When adding two numbers after adding two digits of the same index part of resurt would be transerfed to the next index. The name of this action is carry, there is an acricle about this action in Wikibedia. 

To implement addition of two linked lists, need to have a buffer or `carry` variable, that would be used in each digits addition and transfer data to the next index. On each addition new `carry` value would be calculated.

First need to define `head` that would be returned, and after add the rest of the lists. The `head` will be created from the first elements ot the both lists.

For this algorithm: two pointers, head, tail, carry variables. Method for head creation, loop for adding rest of the lists.

Let's try.

**Important!** Need to append new element to the list if `carry` is not zero.
