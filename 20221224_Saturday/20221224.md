**Ruby/Go: [img] Push DP. Column has four states.**

Basic approach: There four cases how to fill two elements column, each of these cases is a state.
From state of columnt `i` and number of ways this state is reached to appropriate state of the `i+1` column.

![Possible states and transactions.](lc790.png)

- 0. Empty state. Top and bottom cells are empty.
- 1. Top state. Top cell is filled.
- 2. Bottom state. Bottom cell is filled.
- 3. Both state. Both cells are filled.

**UPD**: More concise and elegant [soution](https://leetcode.com/problems/domino-and-tromino-tiling/discuss/1622119/Ruby%3A-Push-DP-ways-to-fill-a-column) based on same principles, were return empty state after the last `dp[n+1][0]`.

Transaction from each states are. Such way to close all gaps at `i` and some gaps at `j`.

- 0. Empty state. Put two horizontal dominos. One vertical. Or one trimino both ways.
- 1. Top state. Put horizontal domino at the bootom or trimino. 
- 2. Bottom state. Put horisontal domino at the top or timino.
- 3. From the Both state, only way it just move to the zero state of the next collumn.

Empty state is only state when transaction not only modify `j` column, but also modify a `Both` state at current `i` collumn. 
Because of that, need to firt calculate `Both state` in the loop, to avoid double count if `Both state` of `i` increased when two horizontal dominos are used.
