While exploring the ruins of a golden lost city, you discovered an ancient manuscript containing series of strange symbols. Thanks to you profound knowlges of dead languages, you realized that the text was written in one of the dialects of Befunge-93. Looks like the prophecy was true: you are the one who can find the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life! Of cource you brought your futuristic laptop with you, so now you just need a function that will run the encrypted message and meke you the all-knowing human being.

Befunce-93 is a stack based programmin language, the progrmas for which are arranged in two-dimensional torus grid. The program execution sequence starts at the top left corner and proceeds to the right unit untill the first direction insturction is met (which can appear in the very first cell). The torus adjective means that the program never leaves the grid; when it encounters a border, it simply goes to the next command at the opposite side of the grid.

You need to write a funtion that will be able to execute the given Befunge-93 `program`. Unfortunately your laptop, futuristic that it is, can't handle more than `10**5` instructions and will prbably catch on fire if you try to execute more, sothe function syould exing after `10**5` commands. The good news is, the prpphesy saind that athe answer to the Ultimate Question of Life contains no mroe than `100` symbols, so the function shuld retun the `program` output oone is contains `100` symbols.

The dialect of Befunge-93 is the manuscipt consists of the following commands:

- direction instructions:
    - `>`: start moving right
    - `<`: start moving left
    - `v`: start moving down
    - `^`: start moving up
    - `#`: brides; skip next cell.
- conditional instructions:
    - `_`: pop a `value`; move right if `value = 0`, left otherwice
    - `|`: pop a `value`; move down if `vaule = 0`, up otherwice
- math operations:
    - `+`: addition; pop `a`, pop `b`, then push `a + b`
    - `-`: subtractions; pop `a`, pop `b`, then push `b - a`
    - `*`: multiplication; pop `a`, pop `b`, then push `a * b`
    - `/`: integer division; pop `a`, pop `b`, than push `b / a`
    - `%`: modulo operation; pop `a`, pop `b`, than push `b % a`
- logical operations:
    - `!`: logical NOP; pop a `value` if the `value = 0`, push 1, otherwice push `0`
    - "\`": greater then; pop `a` and `b`, then push 1 if `b>a`, otherwise `0`
