While exploring the ruins of a golden lost city, you discovered an ancient manuscript containing series of strange symbols. Thanks to your profound knowledge of dead languages, you realized that the text was written in one of the dialects of Befunge-93. Looks like the prophecy was true: you are the one who can find the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life! Of course you brought your futuristic laptop with you, so now you just need a function that will run the encrypted message and make you the all-knowing human being.

Befunge-93 is a stack-based programming language, the programs for which are arranged in a two-dimensional torus grid. The program execution sequence starts at the top left corner and proceeds to the right until the first direction instruction is met (which can appear in the very first cell). The torus adjective means that the program never leaves the grid: when it encounters a border, it simply goes to the next command at the opposite side of the grid.
