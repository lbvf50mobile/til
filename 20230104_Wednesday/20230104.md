**Ruby/Go: Fill hash-map, iterate over keys.**

Best tactics is to implement as many tasks in one turn as possible, in this case it is three. If value is not divisible by tree without a remainder need to implement two additional task in one more approach, exept when there is only on task of a particular type. I there is only one task of a particular type return -1, it is impossible to implement all tasks in this set of rules.

- Fill hash-map where key is task, value number of task occurences.
- Iterate over entities of the hash-map.
- If value is 1 return -1.
- Increase the counter by integer division by 3, if there is a remainder after division by two add 1 to the counter.
- Return the counter.
