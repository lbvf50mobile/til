# Leetcode: 938. Range Sum of BST.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/571a3fec32dec528f94673f2a64d98f9
 
**Ruby: BFS, Right less then hight, left bigger then low.
 
Questions:  

- Whtn to add a value to a global sum?
- When value is between low and hight.

- When to move right?
- When right is not a `nil` and  when `right.val <= hight`. Right must allows to find most right element.

- When to move left?
- When left exista and `left >= low`  left must allows to find `low'.
 
Notes:  

Because amount is `10**5` need to use iterative apporach and BFS.


Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 938. Range Sum of BST.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :left, :right
#     def initialize(val = 0, left = nil, right = nil)
#         @val = val
#         @left = left
#         @right = right
#     end
# end
# @param {TreeNode} root
# @param {Integer} low
# @param {Integer} high
# @return {Integer}
def range_sum_bst(root, low, high)
    
end
```
