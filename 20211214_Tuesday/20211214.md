# Leetcode: 938. Range Sum of BST.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/discuss/1628903/Ruby%3A-BFS.-Right-less-than-high-left-bigger-than-low
 
**Ruby: BFS. Right less than high, left bigger than low.
 
Questions:  

- When to add a value to a global sum?
- When the value is between low and high.

- When to move right?
- When right is not a `nil` and when `node.val < high`. Node value must allow finding the most right element.

- When to move left?
- When left exist and `node.val > low`, Node value must allow finding `low'.

P.S. Comparison may be strict or not strict. Works in both ways.
 
Notes:  

Because the amount is `10**5` need to use an iterative approach and BFS.


Let's try.

Ruby code:

  queue = [root]
  while ! queue.empty?
    el = queue.pop()
    global_sum += el.val if el.val.between?(low,high)
    queue.unshift(el.right) if el.right &&  el.val <= high
    queue.unshift(el.left) if el.left && el.val >= low

  global_sum
end

Memory Usage: 214.7 MB, less than 58.00% of Ruby online submissions for Range Sum of BST.   
If use strick `el.val < high` and `el.val > low`.
