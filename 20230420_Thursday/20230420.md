**Ruby/Go: Number x in a level: left 2x-1, right 2x.**

Take a look: if split a binary tree into levels, a node `#1` always produces `#1`
and `#2` of a next level. And a node `#2` always produces `#3` and `#4`.

```
       1
   1       2
 1   2   3   4
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
This gives a rule: for node's position `x` left child postion is `2x-1` and
right child postion is `2x`.

Let's compare.

- 1  `2*1-1=1` `2*1=2`;
- 2  `2*2-1=3` `2*2=4`;
- 3  `2*3-1=5` `2*3=6`;
- 4  `2*4-1=7` `2*4=8`;

Correct.

Neet to store level's postion (number) of a node in queue element and in a BFS
loop calculate it's children postions. 

A level's width value is a delta between first and last queue's elements
positions values.
