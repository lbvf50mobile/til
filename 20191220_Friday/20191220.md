First qustion is how to reach the last index. If we jump ower do it counts as like as we reach the spot.
[1,7,2,1]
**Yes. I't possible to overjump**.

Second Idea it to find such solution that maximum jumps is not good.
[3,8,2,1,1,1,1]

**Ok This kind of solution is found**.

#### My approach for solution.

I going to create BST search. 
First I would create an array of booleans filled with `true` of `n` size.
Secon will create a queue where I going to store two wvalues as element `[index,step]`

Then the `while` loop will be created with `queue` is not empty condition.
In the loop's body I going to pop and element from the queue and check do it on the last index, or furter. If this condition is true I going to return the number of steps.

If the retrun does not happes I goin to loop over the `i+0.. i+nums[n]` range of indexes, and if this indexes in not in `used` array I going to unshift them into the queue.

If loops end And I did not reach the last index I going to raise and exception. 
**Start 19:59**

This solution pass test that I created but was `Time Limit Exceeded`  **20:17** 18 minutes

1) So I want to add one more condition in a time of adding element to queue. If next jump going to reach the last index, just return this value, do not wait.

2) And second improvement. Save `greatest index` and start subloop of addling new lements, with a `greatest index`..`index+nums[index]`

**20:37** Fails on [1,1,1,1]
**20:58** Fixed error  `last_used_index +=`

**21:02** Done **1 hr :15 minutes**
