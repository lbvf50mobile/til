**Ruby: Remove elements of the first decreasing pair in copies.**

Create method for checking does array strictly increses. If array does just return true. Otherwise find first decreasing pair, make two copies of the array and remove first and last elements in each copy respectively. Then test modified copies for strictly increasing by calling test method in logical or statement. Return the result of that statement.
