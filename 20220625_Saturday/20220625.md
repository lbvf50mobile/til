What does it mean "Non-decreasin"?
It means `a[i-1] <= a[i]`.

So. I `a[i-1]<=a[i]` is violated ones, It is possbile to make `a[i]` equal to `a[i-1]`. Change `a[i]` one time. 

If there would be one more violation return false. But what about corter caces? If `a[i-1]` is too big?

There are must be several cases.

1. Left most element. if `i-1 == 0` just make it equal to  `i` index.
2. Right most elemen. If `i == nums.size - 1` just make `i` value equal to `i-1` values.
3. If things happend in a middle `i-1` must be less or equal to `i+2`, make `i` equal to `i-1`.

Soluton. One loop. Counter for changes. If there is single violetion use one of tree types of fixes or false.

Let's try.
