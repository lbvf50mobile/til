**Ruby: Test array without both elements of violated pair.**

Find first pair that violates `a[i-1] <= a[i]`. And check would the array be non decreasing if remove `i-1` or `i` from the array.

Let's try.

Ruby code:

  j = nil
  a = nums
  (1...a.size).each do |i|
    if a[i-1] > a[i]
      j = i
      break
    end
  end
  return true if !j
  # Now test is it possible to remove j or j-1.
  remove(a,j) || remove(a,j-1)
end

def remove(a,j)
  (1...a.size).each do |i|
    if i != j && i != (j+1)
      return false if a[i-1] > a[i]
    end
    next if i == j
    if j + 1 == i
      next if 1 == i
      return false if a[i-2] > a[i]
    end
  end
  return true
end
```
