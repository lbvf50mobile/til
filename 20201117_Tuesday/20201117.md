**Ruby: Counter of consecutive odds in the loop. **


Create variable num that going to store number of consecutive odds in a row. First this variable will be zero, on each even value it will be reset to a zero too. When during iteration over an input array odd element met, num will be increased. If at the an of an iteration the num value is 3 return true. If loop is finished an no returns, time to return false.
