**Ruby: DFS and HashMap.**

Ok. If a graph is a tree it is very simple to implement such kind of DFS. But what if a vertex is already visited?  
In case of visited vertex need to use HashMap and take new vertex from this HashMap using input vertex as a key.

Let's try.

Ruby code:

def cloneGraph(node)
  @created = {}
  dfs(node)
end

def dfs(node)
  return node if ! node
  return @created[node] if @created[node]
  ans = Node.new(node.val)
  @created[node] = ans
  ans.neighbors = node.neighbors.map{|x| dfs(x)}
  return ans
end
