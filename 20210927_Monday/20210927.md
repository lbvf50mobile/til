**Ruby: Remove dotes and pluses.**

Need to convert each email to it's state after clearing all ingored parts. That means remove all dotes from the local name, and remove every thing after a plus simbol inclusive.

I think using set will makes code a little bit more complicated, I going to use uniq method for arrays. And map array to remove all ingorad parts from a local name. For removing ignored parts sparate lambda would be create, that going to split adress by `@`, then using couple of `Regex` removes ignoring information from a local name. Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby

def num_unique_emails(emails)
  purge = ->str{ 
    local,domain = str.split(?@)
    local.gsub!(/\./,"")
    local.gsub!(/^([^+]+).*/,'\1')
    local + ?@ + domain
  }
  emails.map(&purge).uniq.size
end
```
