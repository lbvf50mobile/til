# Leetcode: 224. Basic Calculator.

**Ruby: Loop and Stack.**

Starting reasonoing.

When working with a long chain of arithmetic operations in current task, it could be represented as sequence of actions: `total + sign * current_digit`.  
Where `sign` is `1` of `-1` total is a total sum and current digit generating during reading symbols from the string.  
At the begining `total = 0` and `sign = 1`.   

When consequtive sequence of numbers finished it's time to implement an operation. When meet number it could be:

- Only digit: if s.size == 1 ... this makes more commplicated.
- First: first index or prev index is not a number.
- Middle: not last index and prev and next are numbers.
- Last: last index or next index is not a number. (at the last digit just make flush)
- (I think this might be improved, if current is zero first and not first could be skipped)
