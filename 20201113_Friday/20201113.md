**Ruby: Iterate from 0 till 100 and count elements that greater or equal.**

The number that makes an array special is in bounds of the size of this array. Iterate from 0 till the array size, count elements in array that larger or equal to a current loop variable if variable is equal to amount return that number.

Curious thing that with each optimization of the code of this task it's took more time to accept. First I sort an array and iterate from 0 till 100, then I skipped sorting, and finally I start iterate not till maximal bound of an array but till it's actual size. And time grows every time 48, 60, 64 ms.
