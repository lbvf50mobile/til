# Leetcode: 97. Interleaving String.

**Ruby: Pull DP.**

This code is a translation of the [vanAmsen's solutoin](https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/discuss/3956393/99.78-2-Approaches-DP-and-Recursion) from Python to Ruby. It is a DP where subproblem address is an index in first and second strings. It is a pull dp techincs where current value aquired from previous one.
