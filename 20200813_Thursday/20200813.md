Create Hash from arr2 where hash represented by (value/index) paris where keys is a value and it stores index of an element. Next separate elements from arr1 that are keys in Hash, ans sort them by a Hash values, also separate elements that are not in a distinct array ans sort them ascending. Finally concatenate these two sorted parts and return resulting array.
