First preparations calculate total amount of candy that Alice and Bob has. Next create a hash that stores what sizes of candy each sweets owner has, sizes will be keys in these Hash maps. Now iterating over all Alice candies solve such equity `Alice_sum - candy + x = Bob_sum + candy - x` and thus `2*x = (Bob_sum + candy) - (Alice_sum - candy)` and `x` will be candy size Bob need to return. Check that `2x` is positive, even, and `x` exists in Bobs hash. And return `[candy, 2x/2]`. Done.
