**Ruby/Go: Return number of the unsorted columns.**

Need to calculate number of unsorted columns. If moving from the 0 row till the end one, column's values must be ascending.

Ruby code:

# @param {String[]} strs
# @return {Integer}
def min_deletion_size(strs)
  # Convert strings to matrix.
  # And make columns rows and make rows columns
  mtrx = strs.map(&:chars).transpose
  # Retrun number unsorted rows, those rows need to be deleted.
  return mtrx.count{|x| !sorted(x)}
end

def sorted(x)
  (1...x.size).each do |i|
    return false if x[i-1] > x[i]
  end
  return true
end
```

var m,n int
var s []string
func minDeletionSize(strs []string) int {
  s = strs
  m = len(strs)
  n = len(strs[0])
  count := 0 // Count of the unsorted columns.
  // Iterate over each column.
  for j := 0; j < n ; j += 1 {
    if ! sorted(j) { count += 1 }
  }
  return count
}
func sorted(j int) bool {
  // Iterate over rows startign from one.
  for i := 1; i < m; i += 1{
    if s[i-1][j] > s[i][j] { return false }
  }
