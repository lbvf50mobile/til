**Ruby: Insert middle of the array.**

On each recursion call insert into the binary tree a middle of the array. And call the same method for the left part before the middle and the right part after the middle. Neeed to add `insert` method that inserts data into the tree. Or even better! Return root on every call and left and right valued would be from the recurcive calls.

Let's try.

Ruby code:

  return nil if nums.empty?
  return TreeNode.new(nums[0]) if 1 == nums.size
  return TreeNode.new(nums[1],sorted_array_to_bst(nums[0...1])) if 2 == nums.size
  left = sorted_array_to_bst(nums[0...nums.size/2]) 
  right = sorted_array_to_bst(nums[nums.size/2+1..-1])
  return TreeNode.new(nums[nums.size/2],left,right)
end

```
