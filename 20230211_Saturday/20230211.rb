def shortest_alternating_paths(n, red_edges, blue_edges)
  # Based on:
  # https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-with-alternating-colors/solution/
  # Create an adjacency list adj that contains a list of pairs of integers such that adj[node] contains the neighbors of node in the form (neighbor, color) where neighbor is the neighbor of node and color denotes the edge color that connects node and neighbor. We use the number 0 for red and the number 1 for blue.
