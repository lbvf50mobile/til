**Go: Like a diverging circles.**

Two pointers start from a current point, move in the different directions till
they are pointing on the same chars, the loop moves, the counter increases.
Start two functions for each index: one for odd palindromes (pointers start at
the same indices), one for the even palindromes (pointers start at the
neighboring indices).

Got hint from [shawngao](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/discuss/105689/Java-solution-8-lines-extendPalindrome).
