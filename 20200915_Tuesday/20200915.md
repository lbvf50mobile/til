Ruby solution: sort by size and compare a word with a rest ones.

Sort words ascending by their size, loop over all words except last one. If current word in an iteration is substring of any word further in sorted words array push this word in an answer array.

P.S. Second solution time consuming vary from 11% to 100%. Each call show different time. And memory I supporse, but I did not check.
