In 2-d prefix sum, first calculated a value of cell for current row as like as for one dimensional  row. And than add value from the same colum in row above.

```
Array:
1, 2, 3;
1, 2, 3;
1, 2, 3;

Creating two dimensional Prefix array:

1,3,6;
1+1, (1+2) + 3, (1+2+3) + 6
1+1+1, (1+2) + 6, (1,2,3) + 12
```
