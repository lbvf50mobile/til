**Ruby: Move around borders, fill with Z.**

Move around bordes, start BFS on each "O", fill with "Z". Then all not "Z" to "X", all "Z" to "O".  

Let's try.

 
Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 130. Surrounded Regions.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/
# @param {Character[][]} board
# @return {Void} Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
def solve(board)
    
end
```
