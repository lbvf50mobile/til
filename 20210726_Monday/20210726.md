**Ruby: Middle as node, left and right recursion sub calls.**


Recurcive solution. Recursive function gets two pointers on first and last elements of an interval. Set middle element as a node value, call first, middle-1 for left, and middle+2 for right. If first element pointer stays beyond the last element return nil as a node.  

As a hint I used this video https://youtu.be/PZYTs9y4f4o - nice one. Really appreciate that work of Kevin Naughton Jr.

  return nil if l > r
  mid = l + (r-l)/2
  left = rec(l,mid-1)
  right = rec(mid+1,r)
  return TreeNode.new(@a[mid],left,right)
