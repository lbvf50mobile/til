Create array that stores all incoming times. Create two pointers first points on the newest incoming call, second on the last call that is not far then 3000 seconds ago.
When new call arrive move second pointer until difference between newest incoming call and pointed one will be less than 3000. 

On every incoming call just move the pointer in the loop.
