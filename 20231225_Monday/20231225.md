# Leetcode: 91. Decode Ways.

**Go: Push DP with two optimizations.**

The solution is a basic Push DP that depends on the current and next symbols.
Optimizations are to return zero if the first symbol is `0`, and return zero
if two zeros in a row.

If the first element is zero, it would be skipped, and further, only zeros
would be copied in the DP.

If two zeros in a row this gap could not be jumped over, and the rest of the
input would have the same situation, just copying zeros in the DP.
