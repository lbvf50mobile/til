**Ruby: Push DP. Sub-problem address move and position.**

Push DP is used. Write value to a position at the next move. Create several fields and from each cell push its value to the next move field. Move implemented from current move field to the next move field in appropriate cell. Number of fields equal to `max_move + 1` to save positions after the last move. After updating every cell use modulo operation to avoid overflow (in Ruby it would not happens, but for other languages and as a part of the algorithmic solution).


**Error:**
 
- When created a DP inseat using `m` and `n` as interers, call `#size` method on them.

**P.S:**

To get information about DP [Errichto lections could be used](https://github.com/Errichto/youtube/wiki/DP-lecture).
