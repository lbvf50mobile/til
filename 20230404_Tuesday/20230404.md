# Leetcode: 2405. Optimal Partition of String.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/f43ddb5d6eeab1fda8df7b6d2cd06fea

**Ruby: As soon as a conter shows twice add new one.**

Use a counter structure which counts number of a symbol occurrences, at the end
of the loop and each time a symbol count is more than one increase the answer.
