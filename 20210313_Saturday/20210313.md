## Approach 1: Prev next Array.

## Intuition.

Let's try to count the number of sub arrays hash j for which ay index j is the right most minimum. Then The answer will be sum  hash j multiply by ay j. We must say right most so that we from  disjoint sets of sub arrays and do not double count any, as the minimum of an array may not be unique.   

This in turn bring as the question of knowing the smallest index i less or equal to j for which ay index i, ay index i pus one, ay index j plus 2 and till ay index k are all great or equal to ay index j; and the largest index k greater or equal to j for which ay index j plus one, ay index j plus two and a index are all greater then ay index j.   

## Algorithm.
