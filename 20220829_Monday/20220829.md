# Leetcode: 200. Number of Islands.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/discuss/2500810/Ruby%3A-An-Island-is-an-unvisited-one.

**Ruby: An Island is an unvisited one.**

Iterate over all cells of the grid, if cell is one and it is unvisited start BFS marking cells visited.

Let's try.

P.S. During this solution I had two errors.
1. Did not implement check for "1"/"0" at the BFS.
2. Did not implement "1"/"0" check for strings, implemented that check for integers.

Both fixed.

Tests:
```
[["1","1","1","1","0"],["1","1","0","1","0"],["1","1","0","0","0"],["0","0","0","0","0"]]
[["1","1","0","0","0"],["1","1","0","0","0"],["0","0","1","0","0"],["0","0","0","1","1"]]
[["1","0","1"]]
[["1"],["0"],["1"]]
[["1"]]
