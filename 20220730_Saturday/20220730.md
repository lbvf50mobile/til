# Leetcode: 916. Word Subsets.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/word-subsets/discuss/2354897/Ruby%3A-Bit-mask-of-matched-characters-and-characters-counters.

**Ruby: Bit mask of matched characters and characters counter.**


- Combine bit masks from `words2`
- Map `words1` into the set of bitmasks.
- Filter array from step two by bit mast from the step one.

Let's try.


Tasks turned to be much more interesting. Need to use counter of used characters and also generate global counter to reach `O(N*M)` complexity were `N` is size of `words1` and `M` size of `words2`.
