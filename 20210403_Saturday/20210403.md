**Ruby: Regex substitute.**

Convert knowledge array into hash where first element of a pair is a key. Then using Regex substitute hash's key entrence by current value, if there is no such entrence substitute it by question mark.  Regex can be translated like: open round bracket symbol then "not a close bracket symbol" one or more times and close bracket symbol.

def evaluate(s, knowledge)
    hash = knowledge.to_h
    s.gsub(/\([^)]+\)/){|x| 
        z = x[1..-2]
        if hash[z]
            hash[z]
        else
            ??
        end

It is my 500's problem in the Leetocode. Thanks God!
