**Ruby: Map, count and hypotenuse.**

Map circles array into number of points thay have. In each call of map block treat distance between points as hypotenuse and intervals on axis as rectangular tirangle legs. Point is in a curcle if "hypotenuse" is less or equal than "radius". That's it.

Thank you for reading. Wish you happy coding.
