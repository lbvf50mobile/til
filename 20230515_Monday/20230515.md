- https://leetcode.com/problems/swapping-nodes-in-a-linked-list/discuss/3528500/RubyGo%3A-List-to-array.

**Ruby/Go: List to array.**

Summary: Need to read a description more carefully. It is a golden rule.

- Ruby sweap elements. (Did not read the description carefully.)
- Go sweap values. (Finialy did.)
