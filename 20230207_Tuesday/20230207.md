- https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/discuss/3157610/RubyGo%3A-Sliding-window-hash-map-and-variable.

**Ruby/Go: Sliding window, hash-map and variable.**

It is a sliding window.

Grow while type's amount is less or equal to two.  
Shrink when the amount of types is greater than two.  

- What is a max number? Max number is a length.
- How to define a length? `j-i`.
- What are `i` and `j`? Is is a bounds of a sliding window [i,j), `j` is not include.
- How to check number of types in sliding window? By a set.

Let's start.

P.S. Also need to have a Hash map for countint how many trees of such type in a window, and with this map number of types could be saved in a variable (no need to have a set).
