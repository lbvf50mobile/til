**Ruby: Moving away from a root, double dot pop element.**

Core idea of this task move from the root after a split by slash. 
Ignore single dot and empty strings, pop on double dot, otherwise push.

After a loop join by slash.

Let's try.

Ruby code:

  return path if ?/ == path

  stack.empty? ? ?/ : ?/ + stack.join(?/)
