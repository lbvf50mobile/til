Core Idea: Spend one interation of main loop on each day from 1 to the
last_day of last event. 

During that iteration, a Heap would be used, first all untouched events that
started before current day would be added to the heap, than in second
sub-loop, all events that finished before "today" would be poped.

And at the very and of the main iteration, would be select one event, that
will end sooner than all others in a heap, and this event will increase the
counter. And poped. From heap.

Short:
Iterate over each day.
Keep all available days for "today" in heap (by two loops).
Select one that will finished sooner, and pop it increasing answer counter.

One more explanation: For each day for each day find all events could be
attended (by two steps start and end time), put them in heap, select one that
ends sooner than others.
