lc1751 Maximum number of events that can be attended II.

Overview

We can only attend an event if the start day of it is greater than the end day
of the previously attended event. This implies that we should sort events by
their start time. As showing in the following figure, we sort
events =
[
[1,2,4],
[3,4,3],
[2,3,1],
[4,6,5],
[2,4,8],
]
Sort
events =
[
[1,2,4],
[2,3,1],
[2,4,8],
[3,4,3],
[4,6,5,]
]
