3307. Find the K-th Character in String Game II

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string word equal to "a".

You are given a positive integer k.
You are also given an integer array called operations, where operations of i represents the type of the i-th operation.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform all operations in sequence:

If operations of i equals zero, append a copy of word to itself.

If operations of i equals one, generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append this new string to the original word.
For example:

Performing the operation on "c" generates "cd".

Performing the operation on "zb" generates "zbac".

Return the value of the k-th character in word after performing all the operations.

Note: In the second type of operation, the character "z" is changed to "a".

Hint 1:
Try to replay the operations that the k-th character was part of.

Hint 2:
The k-th character is only affected if it is present in the first half of the string.
