Intuition
The general idea of this problem is the same as that of “Find the K-th Character in String Game I,” with the only difference being that we need to determine which operation the current k is located in.

Let k equal two to the power of t plus a.
If a equals zero, then the current k is in the (t minus one)-th operation;
if a is not equal to zero, then the current k is in the t-th operation.

This conclusion can be easily derived by simulating with small amounts of data.

After determining the number of operations corresponding to the current k, we can decide whether to accumulate the answer using the operations array provided in the problem.
If operations at index t equals one, we perform the accumulation; otherwise, we do not.
