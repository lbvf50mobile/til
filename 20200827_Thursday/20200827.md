- https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-it-is-a-straight-line/discuss/815052/Ruby-solution%3A-same-slope-between-all-combinations-with-first-point.


Idea behind this solution is that slope between first point and all others must be the same. What is a slope, it is a quotient between x distance and y distance of two points, it called dx and dy. First calculate slope between first two points, and than compare slope between first point and rest of them with first slope. 

It is may happens that dy or dx are the same because it is horizontal or vertical line, and y and x values are same between all points respectively. These cases are added two.
