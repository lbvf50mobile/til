**Ruby: O(NLogN). Move left step by step. Right part with a binary search (or hash map).**

1. Create two prefix arrays.
2. Right-to-left just move pointer.
3. Left to right part implement search for x - right.
4. Calculate the answer. `(i+1) + (size - j)`. 
5. Also the solution coud be get from the right.

Ok. Let's start.

Ruby code:
