# Leetcode: 134. Gas Station.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/discuss/3014608/RubyGo%3A-Set-the-next-station-if-cannot-reach-it-with-tank-plus-gas.

**Ruby/Go: Set the next station if cannot reach it with tank plus gas.**

- First idea if all gas is less than all costs cannot make the circle treap.
- Second idea, if cannot reach next station with gas in the tank and gas from station, need to try from next station with empty tank.
