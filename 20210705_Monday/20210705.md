# Leetcode: Count Vowels Permutation.

- https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge-2021/608/week-1-july-1st-july-7th/3802/

Solution based on Dynamic Programming Pull DP. Subproblem addred by lengh of the string and the last character stores number of substrings that enens by this character. Data structure is array of 5 elements element per vowel. Because addressing only one step back, may avoid saving all DP data structure in memory just save sum and currend 5 elements.

Create Adjacency where following character stores precieding characters, and characters mapped to indices:
```
a => 0
e => 1
i => 2
o => 3
u => 4

a => e
e => a,i
i => a,e,o,u
o => i,u
u => a

e,i,u <= a
a,i <= e
e,o <= i
i <= o
i,o <= u

1,2,4 <= 0
0,2 <= 1
1,3 <= 2
2 <= 3
2,3 <= 4

[[1,2,4],[0,2],[1,3],[2],[2,3]]
```
