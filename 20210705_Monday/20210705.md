**Ruby: Count Vowels Permutation. Pull DP.**

Solution based on Dynamic Programming Pull DP. Subproblem addred by lengh of the string and the last character stores number of strings lengh N that eneds by this character. Data structure is array of 5 elements element per vowel. Because addressing only one step back, may avoid saving all DP data structure in memory just save sum and currend 5 elements.

Create Adjacency list where following character stores precieding characters, and characters mapped to indices:
```
a => 0
e => 1
i => 2
o => 3
u => 4

a => e
e => a,i
i => a,e,o,u
o => i,u
u => a

e,i,u <= a
a,i <= e
e,o <= i
i <= o
i,o <= u

1,2,4 <= 0
0,2 <= 1
1,3 <= 2
2 <= 3
2,3 <= 4

[[1,2,4],[0,2],[1,3],[2],[2,3]]
```
