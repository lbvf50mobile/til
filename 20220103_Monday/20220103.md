**Ruby: Array of pairs or Two Arrays.**

For each person store number of people this person trusts, and the number of people this person trusted by (Number of persons who trusts this person). Trust number and trusters number.

There are `n` people. Judge trusts `0` and `n-1` trust him. Need to create an array of `n+1` pairs to be able to access indices from `1..n`. 

And iterate over the input array increase the first element of the pair for an index if a person trusts, and a second element if the person trusted by one. Or just two arrays could be used with `n+1` numbers. This looks faster.

When iteration over an input array is finished, iterate from `1` till `n` inclusive. And found a person who has `0` in `trust_arr`, and `n-1` in `trusted_arr`.  And return this index or return `-1` at the end of the method.
