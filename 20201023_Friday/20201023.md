**Ruby: Save visited points in the hash. Return true if visited twice.**

On each step the character moves to a new point with integer values of x and y coordinates, because it always move by one unit and could turn at the angle multiple of 90 degrees.
To check does a path crossed, need save all visited points in some sort of data structure, and check on every move do such point coordinates exist in this structure. Return true if there are such coordinates.
