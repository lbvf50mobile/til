# Leetcode: 785. Is Graph Bipartite?

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/9dba07e623d3969b3afdd5c505aad1c0

**Ruby: BFS, descendands must have different color.**

Solution is based on the [AlphaZero solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite/discuss/119514/Python-3-BFS-DFS-solutions).

Let's start reasoning.

There are n steps and colored hash map. Create a main loop, this loop is for each vertes of the graph.  
Ok `colored` is used as an extedned `visited` for stadard BFS. 

Start from only at uncolored vertexes. Not colored color in oposite collor. If meet same color return false. 


Look like graph is colored by layers. And new layer need to have differen color. But that is for trees.  
For graphs descanands must have other color. And alwasy start color from 1.

Let's try.

  colored = {}
  (0...graph.size).each do |i|
    next if colored[i]
    colored[i] = 1
    q = [i]
    while ! q.empty?
      cur = q.shift
      graph[cur].each do |nv|
        if colored[nv].nil?
          colored[nv] = - colored[cur]
          q.push nv
        elsif colored[nv] == colored[cur]
          return false
        end
      end
    end
  end
  return true
end
