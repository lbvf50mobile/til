**Ruby: Erase close brackets in first loop, erase open brackets by indices in second.**

Use stack to save indices of redundant open brackets. 
Push indices of open brackets in the stack, pop on close brackets.  
If there is a close bracket and no open bracket in the stack, erase it.   

Code is based on [this solution of Slava Herasymov](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses/discuss/1073038/Python-or-Fast-and-Easy-or-Beats-98).
