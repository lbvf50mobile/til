# Leetcode: 2870. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/d1b36f96561b7710d5d95bb424139250

**Go: Amount, amount-2, amount-4 divisible by 3, or amount divisible by 2.**

- Create a Counter Data Structure (count number of matches for the each
  element).
- Iterate over amounts of numbers occurrences.
- If amount, amount-2, amount-4 divisible by 3, or amount divisible by 2. This
  digit could be removed from an array.

  There is no need to test amount-6, because 6 is three times by two.
