1.Calculate the length of 2 Linked Lists - l1,l2;
2. then find the difference of their length's d = |l1-l2|;
3. Move Larger LL by d steps and then move both heads , to the point where they meet , which is the intersection

This Code essentially does the same thing cause the longer LL's pointer keeps on moving
till tail->next or NULL is reached and the smaller list must have been exhausted by then & it' s head would have moved |l1-l2| steps in front


```
 ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
    ListNode *p = headA;
    ListNode *q = headB;
    while (p  || q) 
    {
        if(p)
            p = p->next;
        else
            headB = headB->next;
        
        if(q)
            q = q->next;
        else
            headA=headA->next;
        
    }

    while (headA != headB) 
    {
        headA = headA->next;
        headB = headB->next;
    }
    return headA;
}
```
