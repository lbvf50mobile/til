**Ruby: Find sum, sort in decreasing order, count sub sum in a loop.**


Calculate total sum of the array first, than sort array in decreasing order. Create variable sub_sum and increase it by an element on every iteration of a loop. When sub_sum become greater than sum of rest of the array, return slice of sorted array from 0 till current index inclusively.
