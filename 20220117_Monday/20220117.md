**Ruby: First string char is the second string word.**

A character in the first is strongly related to a word in the second string. The character connected only with one word.
That create several rules:

1. Number of characters in the first string must be equal to the number of words in the second string.
2. If meet an unknown word and an unknown character create a connection by two hashes.
3. Further if char or word in known they must be in connection, if not return `false`
4. The `true` returned at the end of the method, after the loop.
5. Let's try.
