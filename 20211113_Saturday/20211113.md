# Leetcode: 739. Daily Temperatures.

**Ruby: Move backwards, degree-date map.**


- Because need to get data from the "future" need to iterate the array backwards.
- Because there are only 71 types of temperature, it is possible to create an array-based map of the last index of such temperature matched.
- Also there are possible optimizations for repeating temperatures in a row and increasing sequences when tomorrow is warmer.
