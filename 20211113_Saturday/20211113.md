**Ruby: Move backwards, degree-date map.**


- Because need to get data from the "future" need to iterate array backwards.
- Because there are only 71 type of temperature, it is possible to creat an array based map of last index of such temperature matched.
- Also there possible optimizaion for repeating temperatures in row and decreasing sequences.


Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 739. Daily Temperatures.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/
# @param {Integer[]} temperatures
# @return {Integer[]}
def daily_temperatures(temperatures)
    
end
```
