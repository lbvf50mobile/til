**Ruby: Sorted array of hypotenuse squares.**

This task could be solved by the heap. But I going to try to solve it by a sorted array. To avoid of sqrt operation, I going to sort a square of hypotenuses.

- Map array into pars, a square of a hypotenuse and points.
- Sort by hypotenuses.
- Select first k elements.
- Map bach to the points.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 973. K Closest Points to Origin.

# @param {Integer[][]} points
# @param {Integer} k
# @return {Integer[][]}
def k_closest(points, k)
  x = points.map{|point| [ point[0]*point[0] + point[1]*point[1], point]}
  x.sort_by{|arr| arr.first}[0...k].map(&:last)
end

```
