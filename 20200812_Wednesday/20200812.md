Create loop that iterates until there more than zero candies and two variables amount of candies to give and index, index grows on each iteration and amount grows too. To get index of person to add amount of candies modulo operation could be implemented or rest of division index variable by number of people. In each iteration delete amount from candies. If there less candies than amount for gift give all the rest of candies to a person.
