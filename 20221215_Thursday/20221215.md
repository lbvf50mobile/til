**Ruby/Go: Subporblem's address is positions were substrings end.**

Time: `O(m*n)`; Memory: `O(m*n)`; Where `m` is a size of `text1` and `n` is a size of `text2`.

Basic Indea of this algorithm is if two substrings that start from the beginig ends on the same character, longest subsequence is greater by one then these substrings character ago. This is a key idea. As an address of subporblems is two digits that indicates indices of last characters of substrings which starts at the begining.
