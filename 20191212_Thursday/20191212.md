And improved **sliding window** by Alexand Fedorov where left column not moved by ineration but got from hash.

```Ruby
# https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/solution/
# Runtime: 52 ms, faster than 99.15% of Ruby online submissions for Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.
#Memory Usage: 9.4 MB, less than 100.00% of Ruby online submissions for Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

# Aleksandr Fedorov (@faos) algorithm
# @param {String} s
# @return {Integer}
def length_of_longest_substring(s)
    hash = {}
    start = 0
    ans = 0
    (0...s.size).each do |finish|
        char = s[finish]
        # jumping over dublicate (but in boars of current interval)
        if hash[char] && start <= hash[char]
            start = hash[char] + 1
        end
        hash[char] = finish
        ans = finish - start + 1 if (finish-start+1) > ans
    end
    ans
end
