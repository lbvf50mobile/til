**Ruby: Separate method for time calculation and binary search.**

Create a separate method for time calculation for a current speed.


Create a Binary Search. The left border is a minimum possible speed of 1 banana per hour, the right border is a maximum possible speed is the size of the maximum heap. Calculate middle speed. Get time to eat all heaps by this speed.

If a time is less or equal to the input hours, speed could be decreased. And set current middle_speed as the right value.
If a time is bigger than input hours, need increase speed. The next step after the middle_speed would be a left value.

Return right value when the left border would not be less than right border.
