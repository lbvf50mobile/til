## Question

Here is the query:
```
    SELECT a.name as Employee, b.name as Manager from Employee as a
    LEFT JOIN Employee as b
    ON a.ManagerId = b.Id AND a.ManagerId IS NOT NULL
    WHERE 1
```

It works on this table:
```
    +----+-------+--------+-----------+
    | Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
    +----+-------+--------+-----------+
    | 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
    | 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
    | 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
    | 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
    +----+-------+--------+-----------+
```

As Ides this query shold show all Employers. A set of rows that have  a.ManagerId = b.Id.

And everthing works fine, exept rows

`Sam, NULL`
`Max, NULL`

Why do these rows returns. If I set `a.ManagerId is NOT NULL` in the `ON` clause.


## Answer

Not because of NULL, but because of how do the 'ON' works. 'ON' give all A rows connected with B rows by some rule. Anyway all A rows will be presented in the answer. Next to filter A rows, need to use 'WERE'. In this case add a rule for ON it did not attach B rows for case where ManagerID is NULL, but it does not reject this row
