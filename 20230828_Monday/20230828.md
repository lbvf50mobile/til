- https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/discuss/3972785/Ruby%3A-Push-O(1)-Pop-O(n).

**Ruby: Push O(1), Pop O(n).**

Translation of the Leetcode's [soltuion](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/solution/).
Push - just add to a queue.
Pop - create a new queue from all elements of the current queue except the last one.
