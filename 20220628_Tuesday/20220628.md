**Ruby: Sort decreasing and make array strictly decreasing.**

Make array of frequences sctircly decreasing by forcing next element to appropriate value. Value of the next element is current minus one or less. If next element is less then current minus one do not add someting to the answer, if bigger add difference to the answer.
