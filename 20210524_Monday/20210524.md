**Ruby: Value index Hash and two loops.**


Let's start reasoning.

- Let's define sequence by it's last element, and have some storage to store how many elements in this sequense for some index k. Great.
- Next if there is end of sequens k there must be j and i indexes  that create this value under k index. @a[i] + @a[j] = @a[k]. For i < j < k.
- If there is a hash contains values ans keys, and keys as values it easy to get index i; valuekeys[@a[k] - @a[i]]. And number elements for k sequence is number of key for j sequence increased by one.
- But! Index J my be middle for many sequences. @a[i1] + @a[j] = @a[k1] and @a[i2] + @a[j] = @a[k2]. Need to have matrix so defince j for i, and k for j. To implicit point which sequnce curren j belongs.
-  Ok let's try to make a code.
