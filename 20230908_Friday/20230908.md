# Leetcode: 118. Pascal's Triangle.

**Ruby: ans[i][j] = ans[i-1][j-1] + ans[i-1][j].**

Current element equal to upper row's previuos column's plus current column's ones.

- Create two dimensional array, with first and last elements of sub arrays equal
  to 1.
- Return if size less than 3.
- Start loop over all elements starting from the third row, from second to
  penultimate, use base rule `ans[i][j] = ans[i-1][j-1] + ans[i-1][j]`.
- Return array created at teh step 1.
