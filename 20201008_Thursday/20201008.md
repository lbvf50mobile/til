**Ruby: Iterate from 0 to n-1 and push values in an answer.**

In the input array x's elements stored inside [0,n-1] range, y's elements stored in [n,size-1] range, both ranges has length n. There are n steps if iterate from 0 to n-1, during this iteration both indices calculated for consecutive x and y elements. Push x and y elements inside the answer array on each iteration of the loop that iterates numbers from 0 to n-1 inclusive.
