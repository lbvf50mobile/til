Create dictionary of non-letters with index keys. Create array of letters from string in order. In loop of string size iteration compose answer string, if index is in dictionary add non letter, else insert letter extracted by a pop method from the letters array.

### In place solution:

- https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-only-letters/discuss/713322/Ruby-solution.-Two-pointers-swap-letters-in-place-skip-non-letters-one-by-one-iteration.

Create two pointers left and right one. Make a loop while left pointer is less then right one. If both pointers point on characters swap chars and move them toward each other. If not, just move one  pointer in step until them finally points on letters.
