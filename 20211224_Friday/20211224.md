**Ruby: Sort, shift from sorted, push in answer.**

If there are two intervals `[s1,e1]` and `[s2,e2]`. They are ovelaped if `s1 <= e2 && e1 >= s2`.


- `s1 <= e1` this means the first interval is not too right (Start after the second ends).
```
S1 <= E2
                 (S1)=====================(E1)
   (S2)--------------(E2)
```
- `e1 >= s2` this means the first interval is not to left (Ends before the seconds starts).
```
E1 >= S2
 (S1)=====================(E1)
                     (S2)--------------(E2)
```

It is a rule to merge two intervals `s1 <= e2 && e1 >= s2`.   
Now it is needed to sort intervals by the starts and ends. Because there is no information that intervals are sorted.

And generate a new answer array.   

Push the first element of the sorted array into the answer. Continue operating with two pointers, the first pointer always at the end of the answer array, second at the current element of the sorted array. 

If two elements are overlapped merge them, if not push a new element into the answer array, move the pointer in the sorted array. Until there are no elements in the sorted array. Or it is possible to shift elements from the sorted array. In this case, push into the answer (or modify), and shift from the sorted.
