**Ruby: Fill an array of visits the folded loop, then sort a range and select.**

**UPD: No need to sort. Just select maximum values.**  

Savory part of this task **is to count as visited only one time** sectors that been last at a previous round and will be first at a current one. It is a pitfall of this task. In general the task requires careful reading of the description. And then create array of n+1 element to store number of visits to a sector, iterate over rounds by external loop, iterate over sectors by folded loop. In the folded increase visits only if last sector of previous round is not equal to the current one.

Increasing the sector during a round is a little bit tricky to, need to convert sectors to the zero based indices `sector - 1`, increase it by one `sector - 1 + 1`, then use modulo operation to get next index in bound of circle `(sector - 1 + 1)%n` and then convert it back to one based indices `(sector - 1 + 1)%n + 1` or `sector%n + 1`.

When all rounds are passed need to find maximum value in the visited arrays, sort 1 to n range by values in visited array. And eventually in sorted array select indices that correspond to indices with maximum value of the visited array. That's it.

**P.S. Really do not need to sort array, need just to select 1 based indices of sectors that has maximum visits.**
