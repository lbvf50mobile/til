**Ruby: Get statistic, filter if win, recursion for rest.**

First acquire statistic number of symbols and check wins. If both types wins it is an error. If `X` wins number of `X` is greater by 1 then number of `O`. If `O` wins number of `X` and `O` are equal. After finishing working with wins, run recursive functions that pics `X` and `O` in turns, and check if finish is correct. When there is no one type of symbols to select, there must no be unselected symbols.
