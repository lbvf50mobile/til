**Ruby: Solution translation from Java.**


Ruby translation of the [monotonic stack solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-unsorted-continuous-subarray/solution/). I appreciate the author who wrote it and published.

Ruby code:

  stack = []
  l,r = nums.size, 0
  (0...nums.size).each do |i|
    while (!stack.empty?) && nums[stack.last] > nums[i]
      tmp = stack.pop
      l = tmp if tmp < l
    end
    stack.push(i)
  end
  stack.clear
  (0...nums.size).reverse_each do |i|
    while (! stack.empty?) && nums[stack.last] < nums[i]
      tmp = stack.pop
      r = tmp if tmp > r
    end
    stack.push i
  end
  r - l > 0 ? r - l + 1 : 0
end
```
