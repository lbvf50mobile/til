**Ruby/Go: Select from 0,1,7,30 days.**


This article is more like a log. Not explanation. Interesting that  `if !travel[i]` - added occasionally, did not intede to add this. I suppose it must be not payed. And it's worked.

def mincost_tickets(days, costs)
  # Let's make it simple and primitive.
  # There are only 365 days, so it is a good idea to 366 elements array and just
  # fill this array with minimum values, so it would be like Climbing stairs
  # task.

  payed = Array.new(366,false)
  money = Array.new(366,0)
  days.each do |x|
    travel[x] = true
  end
  # Use Push DP.
  # Each day stores total money spend.
