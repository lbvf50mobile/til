#  Leetcode: 2929. Distribute Candies Among Children II

- https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-candies-among-children-ii/solutions/6805412/the-a-candies-in-loop-skip-if-2-limits-a-oqwp/



I did it. Let me explain.  
First:  
a - amount for the first kid.  
b - amount for the second kid.  
c - amount for the third kid.  

So! Amount for the first kid moves from zero to **limit**, and it would be
`min(n, limit)`. And it is going to be a loop with such amount iterations.

Next for the rest of children.

if `(n-a) > 2 * limit` - it means second or third would get more than limit.
And we should skip it.


Now. We have `a` amount for the first kid. and `c` amount for the third kid,
these two define `b`. If `a` is defined by a loop, it is possible to count
number of variations only by `c` - counting c.

So minimum `c` is when `b` get `limit`. `n-limit-a`. 

And maximum `c` is when `b` get zero. `n-a`.

Now add fuse. 
`min_c = max(0, n-limit-a)`    
`max_c = min(limit, n-a)`   

and number of combinations of current `a` is `max_c - min_c + 1`.

That's all.
