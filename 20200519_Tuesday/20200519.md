# Just PHP FUN 001. Codesignal: Paint Houses. Leetcode: 1237. Find Positive Integer Solution for a Given Equation.


## Codesingal: Paint Houses.

Pull DP.

Color for current home price is this color price + minimum from other color prices from previous home.  Answer is minimum price of the last home. All program is loop over all houses except first one.

- [about pull/push DP techniques](https://youtu.be/YBSt1jYwVfU).
- [Book with clear DP explanation](https://www.byte-by-byte.com/dpbook/).

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# https://app.codesignal.com/interview-practice/task/idSmSy6u2LNiNDjKw
def paintHouses(cost)
    (1...cost.size).each do |i|
        # Red.
        cost[i][0] += [cost[i-1][1], cost[i-1][2]].min
        # Blue.
        cost[i][1] += [cost[i-1][0], cost[i-1][2]].min
        # Green.
        cost[i][2] += [cost[i-1][0], cost[i-1][1]].min
    end
    cost.last.min
end

In loop iterate all over the `x` values from 1 to 1000. On each `x` value check o `z` in bounds `f(x,1) <= z <= f(x,100)`.
If z in bounds.  Make a binary search on function `g(y) = f(x,y)` where `x` is a constant for current iteration.

![if hight decrease low, if low increase hight, on increasing functions. I mean if f(mid) < z  h = mid - 1, f(mid) > z l = mid + 1 ](lc1237.png)
