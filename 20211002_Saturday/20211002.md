**Ruby: DP, Knigh with 1 heath and a bag.**

Concept is that knight always has 1 health and a bag that fullfilled with a bottles from positive rooms,
each bottle kills a monster.


Top-Bottom DP. 
Knight enters a room with minimal health equal 1.  
Need just to cover all monsters, to stay health untouched.
Need to calculate addition to stay a knight allive. 
Addition if negative: - room.  
Addition if room >= 0: 0.  

Ok. What if knight always has 1 live and extra package to spend on monsters?  

Knight enters a room with health and bag.
Need to calculate addition to stay a live and changes in the bag.
If negative: 
- `new_bag = (room + bag) < 0 ? 0 : (room + bag)`
- `add = room+bag > 0 ? 0 : -(room + bag)`


DP arrays stores `cumulattive_add` and second array stored `bag_for_room`. When selecting from two options 
compare `new_cumulabive_add = cumulitive_add + add` and select minumum one for a current room with a
correspongin bag from a choosed room.



 
Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 174. Dungeon Game.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/
# @param {Integer[][]} dungeon
# @return {Integer}
def calculate_minimum_hp(dungeon)
    
end
```
