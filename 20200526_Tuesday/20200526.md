Most tricky part of this task is to determine what does it means... oh. Need just read the descriptions more carefully **function returns pow(2,31) âˆ’ 1 when the division result overflows.**

- Define the sign of answer by multiplying dividend by divisor and divide it on abs(dividend)*abs(divisor).
- Later work with abs values of dividend and divisor. Implement Binary Search.
- If answer does not found during loop, used upper border as answer, because upper border will goes down.
- Need to protect against dividend is zero.
- And check for data overflows to return pow(2,31)-1.
- Return sign * answer.
