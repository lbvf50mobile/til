**Ruby: Backtracking and counter of visited cells.**

Increase `ways counter` when all cells are visited. Prefill `visited counter` with obstacles, treat obstacle as an always visited cell. That's it.

- Find `start cell`, `finish cell`, pre-filled `visited counter` by obstacles.
- Start Backtracking from the start cell.
- Finish backtracking on the `finish cell`, increase ways counter if visited counter equal to the total number of cells.
