Because of size 1 <= nums.length <= 2500 here could not be used recursion. Here need to be used iteration, in this case PULL DP would be used. Two loops first moves forward, second moves backwards. First loop set the lenght of the longest STRICTLY increasing subsecuence where it is the last element. Second loop would iterate backward and select maximum length among all previous element that is smaller that current one.  Also in algorithm would be two variables global maximum to return, and local maximum for current element. Initally array of lenghtes will be initated by ones, because each element is itself Strictly increasing subsecuence length of one. And then in the end of interation of main loop local maximum would be added.
