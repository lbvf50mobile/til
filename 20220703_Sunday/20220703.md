# Leetcode: 376. Wiggle Subsequence.

**Ruby: Subproblem address - index, value lengs of positive and negative start.**

It is a Top-Bottom Recursive DP solution.  
Subproblem address is an index, and it stores two values lenght of positive start and negative start sequences from thisindex.  

Recursive method first requests all elements that smaller than input and took its negative value pair. Starting from positive looking for next negative. Then it requests all elements that bigger then current: starting from negative looking for next positive. And generates positive and negative pair that going to be saved under this index.

In negative I mean sequence that starts from negative value. `[-1,2,-1,2,-1]`   
In positive I maan sequence that starts from positive value. `[2,-1,2,-1,-2]`
