Reasoning based on [Python O(N^2) solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/discuss/7871/Python-O(N2)-solution).

1. Need to sort all elements. Clear. Ascending sorting.
2. Define the `result` variable as sum of first three elements.
3. Create a main outer loop that iterates from begining and stops leaving 2 elements at the end.
4. Define `j` after `i` and `k` move from the back.
5. Inner loop `j` must be less than `k`. And define `sum` as sum of all tree elements.
6. Sum equal to target return sum.
7. Substitute result if absolute difference with sum is less then absolute difference with result.
8. Define where to move depending on sum less then target. 
9. Sum less then target move `j` right.
10. Sum greater the target move `k` left.
11. After both loops return `result`.

Let's try.
