## Some tests.

Given an integer n and an array a of length n, your task is to apply the following mutation to a:

Array a mutates into a new array b of length n.
For each i from 0 to n - 1, b[i] = a[i - 1] + a[i] + a[i + 1].
If some element in the sum a[i - 1] + a[i] + a[i + 1] does not exist, it should be set to 0. For example, b[0] should be equal to 0 + a[0] + a[1].
Example

For n = 5 and a = [4, 0, 1, -2, 3], the output should be mutateTheArray(n, a) = [4, 5, -1, 2, 1].

b[0] = 0 + a[0] + a[1] = 0 + 4 + 0 = 4
b[1] = a[0] + a[1] + a[2] = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5
b[2] = a[1] + a[2] + a[3] = 0 + 1 + (-2) = -1
b[3] = a[2] + a[3] + a[4] = 1 + (-2) + 3 = 2
b[4] = a[3] + a[4] + 0 = (-2) + 3 + 0 = 1
So, the resulting array after the mutation will be [4, 5, -1, 2, 1].

```Ruby
# fail
def mutateTheArray(n, a)
    prev = 0
    (1...a.size).each do |i|
        nxt = i < a.size - 1 ? a[i+1] : 0
        tmp = a[i] + nxt + prev
        prev = a[i]
        a[i] = tmp
    end
    a
end

```
```Ruby
def mutateTheArray(n, a)
   prev = 0
   (0...a.size).each do |i|
        nxt = (i <= a.size-2) ? a[i+1] : 0
        tmp = prev + nxt + a[i]
        prev = a[i]
        a[i] = tmp
   end
   a
end

```

countTinyPairs (Task 2 of 4)
(0:57:21)
Codewriting

You are given two arrays of integers a and b of the same length, and an integer k. We will be iterating through array a from left to right, and simultaneously through array b from right to left, and looking at pairs (x, y), where x is from a and y is from b. Such a pair is called tiny if the concatenation xy is strictly less than k.

Your task is to return the number of tiny pairs that you'll encounter during the simultaneous iteration through a and b.

Example

For a = [1, 2, 3], b = [1, 2, 3], and k = 31, the output should be
countTinyPairs(a, b, k) = 2.

We're considering the following pairs during iteration:

(1, 3). Their concatenation equals 13, which is less than 31, so the pair is tiny;
(2, 2). Their concatenation equals 22, which is less than 31, so the pair is tiny;
(3, 1). Their concatenation equals 31, which is not less than 31, so the pair is not tiny.
As you can see, there are 2 tiny pairs during the iteration, so the answer is 2.

For a = [16, 1, 4, 2, 14], b = [7, 11, 2, 0, 15], and k = 743, the output should be
countTinyPairs(a, b, k) = 4.

We're considering the following pairs during iteration:

(16, 15). Their concatenation equals 1615, which is greater than 743, so the pair is not tiny;
(1, 0). Their concatenation equals 10, which is less than 743, so the pair is tiny;
(4, 2). Their concatenation equals 42, which is less than 743, so the pair is tiny.
(2, 11). Their concatenation equals 211, which is less than 743, so the pair is tiny;
(14, 7). Their concatenation equals 147, which is less than 743, so the pair is tiny.
There are 4 tiny pairs during the iteration, so the answer is 4.

```Ruby
def countTinyPairs(a, b, k)
    last_index = a.size - 1
    i,j = 0, last_index
    answer = 0
    while i <= last_index && j >= 0
        value = "#{a[i]}#{b[j]}}".to_i
        answer += 1 if value < k
        i+=1
        j-=1
    end
    answer
end
```
You are implementing your own programming language and you've decided to add support for merging strings. A typical merge function would take two strings s1 and s2, and return the lexicographically smallest result that can be obtained by placing the symbols of s2 between the symbols of s1 in such a way that maintains the relative order of the characters in each string.

For example, if s1 = "super" and s2 = "tower", the result should be merge(s1, s2) = "stouperwer".

You'd like to make your language more unique, so for your merge function, instead of comparing the characters in the usual lexicographical order, you'll compare them based on how many times they occur in their respective strings (fewer occurrences means the character is considered smaller). If the number of occurrences are equal, then the characters should be compared in the usual way. If both number of occurences and characters are equal, you should take the characters from the first string to the result.

Given two strings s1 and s2, return the result of the special merge function you are implementing.

**Mismatched push and pop.**



```Ruby
def mergeStrings(s1, s2)
    s1 = s1.chars
    s2 = s2.chars
    h1 = s1.each_with_object(Hash.new){|v,obj| obj[v] ||= 0; obj[v] += 1}
    h2 = s2.each_with_object(Hash.new){|v,obj| obj[v] ||= 0; obj[v] += 1}
    answer = ""
    while (!s1.empty?) && (!s2.empty?)
        if h1[s1[0]] == h2[s2[0]]
            if s2[0] < s1[0]
                answer += s2.shift
            else
                answer += s1.shift
            end
        elsif h2[s2[0]] < h1[s1[0]]
            answer += s2.shift
        else
            answer += s1.shift
        end
    end
    answer += s1.join + s2.join
    answer
end

```

Given an array of positive integers a, your task is to calculate the sum of every possible a[i] ∘ a[j], where a[i] ∘ a[j] is the concatenation of the string representations of a[i] and a[j] respectively.

Example

For a = [10, 2], the output should be concatenationsSum(a) = 1344.

a[0] ∘ a[0] = 10 ∘ 10 = 1010,
a[0] ∘ a[1] = 10 ∘ 2 = 102,
a[1] ∘ a[0] = 2 ∘ 10 = 210,
a[1] ∘ a[1] = 2 ∘ 2 = 22.
So the sum is equal to 1010 + 102 + 210 + 22 = 1344.

For a = [8], the output should be concatenationsSum(a) = 88.

There is only one number in a, and a[0] ∘ a[0] = 8 ∘ 8 = 88, so the answer is 88.

```Ruby
# 14/16
def concatenationsSum(a)
    sum = 0
    a.each do |first|
        a.each do |second|
         ## sum += "#{first}#{second}".to_i
         pow = Math.log10(second).to_i + 1
         sum += first * (10**pow) + first
        end
    end
    sum
end
```
