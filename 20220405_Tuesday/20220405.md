**Ruby: Pointers on edges, move left if right is bigger.**

Idea in this solution set pointers at the both ends of the input array. Move left pointer if left line less than right one, otherwise move right one. On every step calculate and check max area.

The approache I took at the [hi-ravi solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/discuss/1915387/Easy-to-Understand-codes-C%2B%2BCJAVAPYTHON).

Let's try.

Ruby code:

def max_area(height)
  # Based on: https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/discuss/1915387/Easy-to-Understand-codes-C%2B%2BCJAVAPYTHON
  i,j = 0, height.size - 1
  ans = 0
  while i < j
    length = j - i
    hgt = min(height[i],height[j])
    ans = max(ans, hgt*length)
    if height[i]  < height[j]
      i += 1
    else
      j -= 1
    end
  end
  ans
end
def min(a,b)
  a < b ? a : b
end
def max(a,b)
  a > b ? a : b
end
```
