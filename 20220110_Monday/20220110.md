**Ruby: Two pointers and sum with a reminder.**

During the addition, two values from the same numeral place and a reminder from the previous place are added.
In Binary numeral system there are **four** possible variants of such kind of adding:
- Total number is 3:  The reminder to the next place is 1 and the current value is 1.
- Total number is 2:  The reminder to the next place is 1 and the current value is 0.
- Total number is 1:  The reminder to the next place is 0 and the current value is 1.
- Total number is 0:  The reminder to the next place is 0 and the current value is 0.

Use two pointers to point on the numerical places at the arguments and a reminder. Loop while ~~both poiters~~ **one of the pointers** bigger or equal to 0. In the loop iteration calculate the total sum of reminder and numerical places values unshift value to the answer array and set a reminder.

**Important!** Do not forget to unshift a reminder after the loop!

Let's try.


**My error during coding:** I used `&&` in the loop condition instead of `||`.
