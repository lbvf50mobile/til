**Ruby: PUSH DP, add value to upper the levels.**

Define level 0 as 1, only one way to get level 0. And then iterate over all levels adding value of current level to the reachable upper ones.

Ruby code:

def climb_stairs(n)
  # A climber stands at the level number 0.
  # he ables to step on a level number 1 or 2.
  # This means need to have n+1 positions to count.
  dp = Array.new(n+1,0) # Note! Must be filled by 0 not nil.

  # There is only one way to get at the bench 0.
  dp[0] = 1

  # Now using PUSH DP technique from each level
  # Number of ways it could be reached will be
  # added to the next rechable stairs.
  (0...n).each do |i|
    dp[i+1] += dp[i] if i+1 <= n # Need to contol bounds.
    dp[i+2] += dp[i] if i+2 <= n # There are only n indices.
  end
  # An answer is a number of ways the last stair is reached.
  return dp[n]
end
