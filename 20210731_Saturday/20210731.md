**Ruby: Calculate each column based on left and right max.**

Calucate value for each column based on left and right max, that borders prevent water from pouring away. First pass over array get maximum for left side, section pass over array from right to left get maxumum from right side, evetually caluclate how many water each column could store, by formula minimum border height minus current height, if there is negative value substitute it by zero. That's all.
