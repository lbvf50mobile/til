**Ruby: Working Draft. Merge into tmp, write tmp in nums1.**


Ok. M in 1 array, and N in 2 array. Must be increasing.

Definetely there are two pointers. And need to write everything into 1.   
Let's imagine that 2 is above and it put elements in frist array.   
Now consider all possible situations.

a - first, pointer is `i`.
b - second, pointer is `j`.


First loop. while `i < m && j < n`. 

1. a[i] == b[j], just `i = i + 1`.
2. a[i] < b[j], just `i = i + 1`.
3. a[i] > b[j], `a[i],b[j] = b[j],a[i]; i += 1; j += 1"

Second loop. All big things must be in b.


too long... just merge in one new array and then write to a.

1. Create tmp.
2. while in bounds push smallest and move ponter.
3. Then push the rest.
4. Write tmp itno a.

Let's try.

def merge(nums1, m, nums2, n)
  tmp = []
  i,j = 0,0
  while i < m && j < n
    if nums1[i] < nums2[j]
      tmp.push(nums1[i])
      i += 1
    else
      tmp.push(nums2[j])
      j += 1
    end
  end
  while i < m; tmp.push(nums1[i]); i += 1; end
  while j < n; tmp.push(nums2[j]); j += 1; end
  (0...n+m).each{|i| nums1[i] = tmp[i]}
end
```
