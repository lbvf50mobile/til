**Ruby: Convert products and prices into Hash.**

Key to this task is to understand that in the constructor arrays pair products and prices is a hash. Where key of the hash is value in the products array and value is value is price value under the same index. After getting that program become very simple, value of the product array's element is a key for the hash to get a price, price multiplied by amount and accumulated in sum. Then discount applied to a total sum, if consecutive number of get_bill call divided without a reminder by n. That's it.
