**Go: Need to see a Linked List in the Slice.**

It is a translation of the DBabichev's [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/discuss/704693/Python-2-solutions%3A-Linked-List-Cycle-O(n)-and-BS-O(n-log-n)-explained). Main tirck is to see that
this slice (array) is a Linked List.
