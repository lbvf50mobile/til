**Ruby/Go: Two solutions. By join and compare. By a loop and 4 variables.**

Ruby solution is short: joing arrays into strings and compare.

Go solution is more complicate but faster.


Let describe an array of stirngs as a matrix. Where words are rows and positions of chacters are columns.

- Define two variables for each array.
- Create a loop with coindition `row` vairialbe is less than array size.
- Return false if elements in cells are not equal.
- Increase the column vaibles.
- If column variable is out of index range set it to zero and move to the next row.
- When the loop is finished both row variables must be equal to the corespond sizes, and column variables set to zero. In this case return true. Return false otherwise.
