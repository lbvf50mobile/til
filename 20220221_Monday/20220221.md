**Ruby: Counter, convert to an array of pairs, sort, select max.**

First, create a HashMap with values as keys and the number of matches as the map's values. Then convert to pairs, sort by amount, return the last (maximum) pair's first value. That first value is the number of matches.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby

  nums.each_with_object(Hash.new){|el,o| o[el] ||= 0; o[el] += 1}

end
```
