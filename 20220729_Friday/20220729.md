**Ruby: Replace characters by character match order.**

Convert string into set of numbers, where each number is order of match a character in this word. For example `abb` would be `1,2,2,` and `mee` will be `1,2,2,` too.

Let's try.


P.S. Error instead of `c` the `?c` wrote. Thus variable was translated to a symbol. Fixed.

Ruby code:
