**Ruby: Select and search.**

First I thought this task could be solved by tow binary searches. But, there are may be several rows with first and last elements that create interval where may be a target. So solved by first: selection appropriate rows, then using binary search.


Ruby code:

def search_matrix(matrix, target)
  @d = false
  @target = target
  matrix.select{|x| target.between?(x.first, x.last)}
    .any?{|x| check_row(x)}
end
def check_row(row)
  value = row.bsearch{|x| x >= @target}
  return false unless value
  p [value, @target] if @d
  value == @target
end
