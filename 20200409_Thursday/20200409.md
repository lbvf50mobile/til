This task is solved as an recursive function, it this function there a loop with N-2 iteration for a polygon. During each iteration we calculate sum of triangles and select minimum one.
How does it achieved.  The edge is selected based on two vertexes last and first one. And N-2 triangles a build in number of vertexes that left. This is how each polygon split in to 3 sub polygons. Polygon before, the triangle, and polygon after. Minimum sum for each of this polygons could be calculated as a recursive call.

This is a recursive function. To calculate a minimum split into triangle pices we select one **edge** between to vertex (let it be an edge between first and last vertex). And draw all possible triangles with this **edge**. It will be **N-2** triangles, because there are **N-2** vertexes beside first and last one.  In this funcion we split the poigon in three sub poligons: **prev poligon**, triange that used this edge, and **future poligion**. 
For eaxmple if we have 5 vertexes with indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, it's could be **prev poligon: [0,1,2]**,  **triange: [0,2,4]**, **future poligion: [2,3,4]**. Each of this poligons could be send in recursive call, or calculated inplace if it has 3 sides.
