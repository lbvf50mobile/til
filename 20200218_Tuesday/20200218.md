In Ruby this task solved by a window implemented as an array. The array was initally sorted, further when window slides by one element, passed element eliminates from sorted array by index search and delete by index. Than new element added to the array. Eventually the array is sorted and median calculated.

In Python solution  steps with searching index of passed element, delete it by index, adding new element, sorting array implemented by sortedcontainers library wich reprents SortedList datastrucure.
