```SQL
/*
https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-emails/submissions/
Runtime: 185 ms, faster than 71.52% of MySQL online submissions for Duplicate Emails.
Memory Usage: 0B, less than 100.00% of MySQL online submissions for Duplicate Emails.
*/
select email as Email from
(SELECT id, email, count(*) as num from Person GROUP BY email) as y
where num > 1
```

And interesting with having:

```SQL
/*

Runtime: 170 ms, faster than 97.53% of MySQL online submissions for Duplicate Emails.
Memory Usage: 0B, less than 100.00% of MySQL online submissions for Duplicate Emails..
*/
select email as Email from Person group by email having count(email) > 1



/*

Runtime: 217 ms, faster than 17.81% of MySQL online submissions for Duplicate Emails.
Memory Usage: 0B, less than 100.00% of MySQL online submissions for Duplicate Emails..
*/
select email as Email from Person group by email having count(*) > 1
```

Why do these both solutions return the same value when: `count(email) > 1` and `count(*) > 1`?

COUNT(expression)
Returns the number of rows that contain non-NULL values.
