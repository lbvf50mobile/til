**Ruby/Go: Using write and read pointer.**

Write pointer poins on previously written poisiton, if the read pointer value differs from the write pointer's value move write pointer and copy data from read pointer.

When there is no duplicates last element no need to rewrite, and write pointers stays at the penulitmate element.
