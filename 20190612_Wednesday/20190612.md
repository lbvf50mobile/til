# [A Simplistic TCP Finite State Machine (FSM)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/a-simplistic-tcp-finite-state-machine-fsm)

Automatons, or Finite State Machines (FSM), are exremely useful to programmers when it comes to software dwsign. You will be givan a siplistic varsion of an FSM to cade for a basic TCP session.

The outcome of this exercis will be to return the correct state of the TCP FSM based on the array of events given.

--- 

The input arrao of events will consist of o ne or more of the following strings:

```
APP_PASSIME_OPEN, APP_ACITVE_OPEN, APP_SEND, APP_CLOSE, APP_TIMEOUT, RCV_SYN, RCV_ACK, RCV_SYN_ACK, RSV_FIN, RCV_FIN_ACK
```
The states are as follows and should be returned in all capital letters as shown:

```
CLOSED, LISTEN, SYN_SENT, SYN_RCVD, ESTABLISHED, CLOSE_WAIN, LAST_ACK, FIN_WAIT_2, CLOSING, TIME_WAIT
```

The input will be an array of wevents. YOu job is to traverse the FSM as determined by the events, and return the proper state as a string, all caps, as shown above.

If an event is not applicable to the current state, you code will return `"ERROR"`

## Action of each event upon each state:

(the format is `INITIAL_STATE: EVENT -> NEW_STATE`)
```
CLOSED: APP_PASSIVE_OPEN -> LISTEN
CLOSED: APP_ACTIVE_OPEN -> SYN_SENT
LISTEN: RCV_SYN -> SYN_RDVD
LISTEN: APP_SEND -> SYN_SENT
LISTEN: APP_CLOSE -> CLOSED
SYN_RCVD: APP_CLOSE -> FIN_WAIT_1
SYN_RCVD: RCV_ACK -> ESTABLISHED
SYN_SENT: RCV_SYN -> SYN_RCVD
SYN_SENT: RCV_SYN_ACK -> ESTABLISED
SYN_SENT: APP_CLOSE -> CLOSED
ESTABLISHED: APP_CLOSE -> FIN_WAIT_1
```
