**Ruby: Compare sorted arrays.**

Reverse any non-empty sub array any number of steps means swap two elements any number of steps, that means possibility to put any element an any position in an array. Or reorder array elements in any way. To solve this task need to put elements in particular orders in both arrays and compare them between each other, just sort them in the same order.
