**Go: Possible to swap positions and a number of occurrences.**

Need to fulfill two conditions.

1. Both strings use the same set of symbols.
2. The sorted amounts of a symbols occurances for both strings are the same.

Go code:

func sameSet(count1, count2 []int) bool {
	for i, v := range count1 {

		if 0 == v && 0 != tmp {

	}
	return true
}

// Counter maker. Map of occurrences.
func getCounter(s string, count []int) {
	for _, v := range s {
		count[int(v-'a')] += 1
	}
