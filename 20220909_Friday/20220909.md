**Ruby: Attack Descending, Defense Ascending.**


Wrong Assumption that this sequence could be sorted by one compare method.

I'll try to sort. By a sort method. And then select number of groups of "equal" elements. Answer is number of gropus minus one. (Does not works)

Next try. Based on the solution.

First sort by attack (!). Than count week. Week are onews who defens is less then maxumum. First maximum is `-Float::INIFINTY`, thus array of one characther have now week elements.

Let's try.

Need to sort tricy. Attack - Descending, start from maxumum attack. But Defence ascending. Dose it plays any role how to sort Defence? Yes it dose. Need to sort defence ascending.
