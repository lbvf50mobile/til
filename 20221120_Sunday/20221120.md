**Ruby/Go: Outer and Inner sign.**

- There is not multipication and division. Thanks why only purpose of parentheses is to change a sign.
- There is two signs, outer for the parantheses and a curent one.
- Current one reset to `1 * ounter` after each number.
- When `-`  inner = `-1 * ounter`.
- When `+`  inner = `outer`.
- when `(` push innter to ounter stack.
- when `)` pop outer. Set current to outer.

Let's try.
