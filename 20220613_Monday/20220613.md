**Ruby: Classical pull DP. A row get information from the upper one.**

From the upper row point of of view `t[0][1]` cat take info from the `t[0][1]` and `t[0][1+1]`. Right below and more right onew.   

Now from the beneath `t[1][2]` could take info from  the `t[0][2]` and `t[0][2-1]`. Right above and more left one.  

Pull minimum sum.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
