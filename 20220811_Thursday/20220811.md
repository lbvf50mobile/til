**Ruby: BFS interrupt on an error.**


Idea is to creat BFS and return `false` if children are not appropriate for BST.

Let's try.

No, this is not enought. Need to rearange solution and save min and max (interval where must be a node). Code is updated. It is a BFS and checking approach from [this soltuion](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/discuss/32109/My-simple-Java-solution-in-3-lines).

Ruby code:

  while ! q.empty?
    x,min,max = q.shift

    return false if min >= val || max <= val
