# Leetcode: 1750. Minimum Length of String After Deleting Similar Ends.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/f10f39ccb815d3bee49e07cbf00b1f81

**Go: Loop while the same from the both ends.**

Main loop works while the same chars from the both ends, internal loop skip
over monolith chunks. One corner case when there is one char left. At the end
return 0 if pointers skip each other or distance between them.
