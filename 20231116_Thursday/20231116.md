**Ruby/Go: In n places could not be n+1 element.**

There are n places for numbers, there could not be stored n+1 element. If
count from 0 til n there would be n+1 element. Need save all nubmers from the
input array in a set and start count from 0 till n+1 till current number dose
not present in the set. Return that number.
