**Ruby: Append one more digit.**

Ok. Store values as a strings. Set `n` and `k` as a "global vairables" and create method that takes array and append new digit to each element.

Some calculations.  
- `current + k = new;` and a `new` must be less than 9.
- `current - k = new;` and a `new` must be bigger or equal to 0.


What does it mean? This means need to filter. If new is not in boud just remove this value from an array.

Now time for solution scheme.

1. Createa array from `1..9` this is first array. Better to have two dimensional array. [[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]...[9]].
2. Create loop for `n-1` step.
3. This main loop calls a function that get answer array and return new one appending new digit.
4. In `append` method start two loops for `+k` and `-k` and check that new digit is between `0..9`.
5. Good Idea to store digist as an array of integers.

Let's try.

Errors:

- Need to add uniq, because when 0 == k, `current + k == curren - k` and there are duplicates. Fixed.  
- `@n-1.times` create loop with one iteration. Need to writes `(@n-1).times`. Fixed.  

UPD. Looks like this solution is BFS, becase un every iteration one more layer is added.
