**Ruby: Backtracking that saves at the end.**

The backtracking function accepts two arguments: index where to start and link to the array of palindromes.

The function accumulates chars into the string. After each addition of string, a palindrome check is implemented. In the case of palindrome, this palindrome adds to the array and new call for the next index performed. Because at end of the backtracking function there is a pop of the last palindrome next call of the loop has the same array state.

When the input index points after the last character it is time to save a copy of the palindromes array into the answer array.
