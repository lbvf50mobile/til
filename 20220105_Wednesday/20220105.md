**Ruby: Backtracking that saves at the end.**


This reasoining is a draft before the code. Not clear explanation but resoning.

Need to define an inteval `[i,j)` that means start at the index `i` and finish at the index `j-1`. This is a recursive function when at the some `j` if the inteval is a `palindrom` add new element to the array or just cotinue to move forward. It could be called two ways backtracking. 

In general a recursive function that has starting point, path_array and current point. All backtracking actions happens when `[i,j)` is a `palindrome`.
 
Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 131. Palindrome Partitioning.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/
# @param {String} s
# @return {String[][]}
def partition(s)
    
end
```
