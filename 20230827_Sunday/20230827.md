# Leetcode: 403. Frog Jump.

**Ruby: DP recursive solution.**

It is hightly rearanged [Leetcode's solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/frog-jump/solution/) translation. I am really qurious
why in the solution dp is a sqare matrix with 2001 elements in both sides?

It there are 2000 elements it is clear. But maximum number of stone position is
caluclated by arithmetic progression. And it is  `1 + (2000-1)*1 = 2000`. Ok now
it is clear.

Great!
