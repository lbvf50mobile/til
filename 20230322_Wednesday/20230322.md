  # 1. Create an adjacency list adj that contais a list of pairs of integers such
  # that adj[node] contails all node's neighbors in the form of (neighbor,
  # weight) where neighbor is the neighboring node of node and weight denotes
  # the weight of the edge that connects node and neighbor.
  @adj = Array.new(n+1).map{ [] }
  roads.each do |a,b,w|
    @adj[a].push([b,w])
    @adj[b].push([a,w])
  end
  # 2. Return bfs(n,adj).
  return bfs(n)

  # 2. BFS words as following.

  # Create a visit array to keep trak of visited nodes. Wealso create queue a
  # and a wariable answer sot to the maximum integer value.
  visited = Array.new(n+1, false)
  answer = 2**32
  q = []
  # We beging by pushin node 1 and marking it as visited.
  q.push(1)
  visited[1] = true
  # We now loop untill the que ue is empty. The queue's first element, node, is
  # popped out. We iterate over all the edges connected to node and for each
  # endge, update answer to the minimum of answer and edge weight. We also check
  # whether or not the node connected to the other end of the edge is visited.
  # If it has not been visited, we visit it and add it to the queue.
  while ! q.empty?

    @adj[node].each do |a,w|

      # even it leads to visited node.
