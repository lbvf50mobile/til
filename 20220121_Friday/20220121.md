**Ruby: Check does the answer exists, search for the answer point.**

The Sum of gas must be greater than costs. If so there is an answer point or starting point where `gas >=  cost`.    

Since these points and further gas tank must be always full. If the tank is not full select the next point.   


Because at the beginning of the method there is a check. Definitely would be starting point between `0` and `size-1`. Thus just moving the start pointer one step right in case of an empty tank would not run out of the array borders. If it is the empty tank on the last index, it must be full somewhere before. Or if it was empty all way down the last index it would be full at the last index. There must be an answer because of the check.

I appreciate Yehudisk for an [example](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/discuss/860347/Python-simple-and-very-short-explained-solution-O(n)-O(1)-faster-than-98).
