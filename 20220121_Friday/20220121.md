# Leetcode: 134. Gas Station.

**Ruby: Check does the  answer exist, search for the answer point.**

Sum of gas must be greater then costs. If so there is an answer point or starting point where `gas >=  cost`.    

Since this points and further gast tank must be always full. If the tank is not full select next point.   


Because at the begining of the method there is a check. definitely vould be starting point between `0` and `size-1`. Thus just moving start pointer one step right in case of empty tank would not run out of the array borders. If it is empty tank on the last index, it must be full somewhere before. Or if it was empty all way down last index it would be full at the last index. There must be an answer because of check.
