# Leetcode: 1503. Last Moment Before All Ants Fall Out of a Plank.

**Ruby/Go: Change direction on meating means NOTHING. Select max path.**

Key to this porblem is that if ants change direction when they meat is equal
they do not meat each other at all. Time when edges would be reached does not
changes, changes only an ant who reaches one or another edge.
