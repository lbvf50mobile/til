**Ruby: Result of modulo operation as a amount of big chunks.**

If there is no way to divide number of elements in a list by a k. There will be
to kind of chunks: small ones equal to arithmetic division size of list by k, and
big ones that bigger than small chanks by one. Amout of big chunks is a
divistion remainder of the lists size by k.
