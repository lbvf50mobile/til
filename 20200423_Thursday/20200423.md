- https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-string-match/discuss/593980/Ruby.-Explanation.-O(A.size-%2B-B.size).

Reasoning #lc686

- First need to have an index where to start apply B string to A
- Second need to have a method that return cycling value of A by index.
- Third need to iterate through all started indices from A and make B.size tests.

The time complexity will be O(A.size * B.size). Worst case start from end of A and Iterate through all B. But one loop nested in another it is O(A.size * B.size).

**Important:** Make sure that A string has all characters from B string. This is one of the TIME consuming tests.
