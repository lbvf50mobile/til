**Ruby: Count consecutive repetitive characters, return max.**

Set answer to one, there is always one letter in this task. Start from the second element (index one) if the current element is equal to the previous increase a counter, if not reset counter to 1. On every iteration save counter to the answer variable, if the answer is less than the counter.
