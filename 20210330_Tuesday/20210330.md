# Leetcode: 794. Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State.

Ruby code, wining positions bit masks:
```Ruby
p "alias x='ruby 20210330_Tuesday/20210330.rb'" 
p "https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/f13743dde4696cbf09124925d05bbb6c"
p "https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-tic-tac-toe-state/"

bottom_row = 1 | (1 << 1) | (1 << 2)
midle_row = bottom_row << 3
top_row = midle_row << 3

p [bottom_row.to_s(2), midle_row.to_s(2), top_row.to_s(2)]

left_col =  (1<<8) | (1 << 5) | (1 << 2)
midle_col = left_col >> 1
right_col = midle_col >> 1
p [left_col.to_s(2), midle_col.to_s(2),right_col.to_s(2)]

left_dig = (1 << 8) | (1 << 4) | 1
right_dig = (1 << 2) | (1 << 4) | (1 << 6)
p [left_dig.to_s(2), right_dig.to_s(2)]

p [bottom_row, midle_row, top_row, left_col, midle_col, right_col, left_dig, right_dig]
```

After win game must be finished, this means, if X wins, there are must be no unmarked O. Even more: after win there must be no unmarked x and o.  

Mark, check for win, if win check for no unmarked places, if not win call recursion. - This is the algorithm. Algorithm is a Back tracking find a valid way to play a game.
To check game finished, need to prepare all marked X and O as a bits, and it going to be called marks mask.   

If no moves and all marked that's true.      

**Ruby: Bits and Recursion."**

Marking X by X and O by O, making marks on exited position. Trying to find way how to select all marks and make a correct game.
Idea of this code, if before move there is no way to mark current and all other marks are marked it is correct game.   
- If it's time to select X, and there no X to select. Ok.
- It it's time to select X, no X to select but there is O. Fail.   

And win line must finish a game, if there is three marks on one type in line there are must no exit any unselected marks.

**I hame a new Idea**: If there is a win row of one type, there could not be a win row of other type. And then it's possible to select elements one by one, consecutively.
