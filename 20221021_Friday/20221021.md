**Ruby/Go: Hash map with element as a key and value as an index.**

Create a hash map where the key is an element from an array and the value is an index for the element. Next, create a loop over the array and check is there a record in the hash map for such array element. If there is such key exist check differenct between current index and an index from a hash map, return true if the difference is less or equal to the k. At the end of the interation set current index for the element in the hash map.

Otherwise return false after the loop.
