// Leetcode: 2558. Take Gifts From the Richest Pile

**Go: Create MaxHeap Type. Use k steps Pop/Push Loop.**

- https://leetcode.com/problems/take-gifts-from-the-richest-pile/discuss/6140408/Go%3A-Create-MaxHeap-Type.-Use-k-steps-PopPush-Loop.

This is a general and quite straightforward solution: Create a `MaxHeap` data
structure and a loop with `k` iterations. In each step of the loop, the
algorithm from the description is implemented: pop, take the square root, and
push back. One interesting aspect of this solution is the handling of data
types; the input gifts is converted from `[]int` to `MaxHeap`, and then the
`&`. operator is used to create a pointer by obtaining the address of the data
structure in memory. This pointer is subsequently used in the `heap.Init`
method.

P.S. During the loop, the sum is constantly updated with each push and pop
operation on the max heap.
