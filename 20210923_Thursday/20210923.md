**Ruby: Change to A or change to B.**

Input into the method is always a Palindrome, there is only one situation when it is impossible to break a palindrome by changing a characker: if Palindrome is one charachter long. If size of a palindrome is 1 return empty string.

Iterate over a half of the palidrome and change first not `a` character to `a`. But if all charachters are `a` just substitue last one by `b`. 

Now need to find the number of iterations of a loop.

- Lenght 2: 01 (0...1). 2//2 => 1;
- Lenght 3: 012 (0...1). 3//2 => 1;
- Length 4: 0123 (0...2). 4//2 => 2;
- Lenght 5: 01234 (0...2). 5//2 => 2;

Need to get upper exclusive index of a loop by an ineger division by two.   
If during this loop there no `a`, substitute last character by a `b`.

Let's try.

def break_palindrome(palindrome)
  return "" if 1 == palindrome.size
  (0...palindrome.size/2).each do |i|
    if ?a != palindrome[i]
      palindrome[i] = ?a
      return palindrome
    end
  end
  # All mirrored characters in the str are 'a'.
  palindrome[palindrome.size-1] = ?b
  return palindrome
end
```
