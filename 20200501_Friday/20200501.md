Fast made Python solution using `heapq`. Need to be carefull about situation when there are no k elements in array yet. May be there is more optimized way to substuture `heap[0]` with new value and then call `heapify`. I used `heappushpop` instead because it shorter to write.  In one call of the `heapq.heappushpop` we get rid of obsolete element and put new one on it's place.  If this method exists may be it's a reason why it created in ordered queue - get one who need to be extracted and add new one to the queue.
