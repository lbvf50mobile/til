**Ruby: Bite from the list, push in the answer.**

Genal Idea is to create loop of `k` iterations and byte chunks from the `list's array` and push them into `answer array`. There are some cases like 
- empty list. 
- list size is less then `k`.
- `list.size` is divisible by `k` without reminder.

All of them has one line solutions and could redturn at the begining of the method.

Next. If `list.size` is greater then `k` and there is a reminder.

Then general Idea is to bite off from the `list` and push in the answer array. First `list` converted in an array, but I going to call it `list` to escape from ambiguity. Because there must be only two sizes of chuks select them as `n` where `n = list.siz//k` the `n` calculates by integer division. And `m` is `n` + 1. Sized of `m` and `n` took from the examples and after some fast reasoning, looks like it must work.

Created a loop with `k` iterations. And in each iterataton two cases.

- `list` is empty push empty sub array.
- `list.size` devisible by `n` without reminder and `list.size/n` would be equal rest of iteration. This is important the rest of the `list` array divided by `n` would be number of iteration inclusive current one. Then push `n`.
- Otherwise push `m` elements.

That's all. 
The algorithm accepted.
Thanks God!
