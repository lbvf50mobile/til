# Leetcode: 907. Sum of Subarray Minimums.

Today I draw scheme with overlapped intervals and how to calculate mins but still got O(N*N) and this not fast enough to pass the tests.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 907. Sum of Subarray Minimums.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/
# @param {Integer[]} arr
# @return {Integer}
# TLE: https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/466877054/testcase/
def sum_subarray_mins(arr)
    sum = arr.sum 
    stack = arr.clone
    (0..arr.size-2).reverse_each do |bound|
        (0..bound).each do |i|
            stack.shift
            min = arr[i] < stack[0] ? arr[i] : stack[0]
            stack.push min
            sum += min
        end
        stack.shift # Extra shift, because number of steps reduced.
    end
    sum % ((10**9)+7)
end
```
