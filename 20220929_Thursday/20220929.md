- https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/discuss/2639554/RubyGo%3A-Minimum-sum-in-sliding-window-of-k-elements.

**Ruby/Go: Minimum sum in sliding window of k elements.** 

Array already sorted. Need to implement Sliding Window alroghtim with size of k. First loop calculete initial sum, second loop move window by one step. Rejecing previos left element and adding new right one. For minimum sum pointers are stored.

- Calculate sum of absolute values of difference between x and array's elements from 0...k.
- Define i = 0 and j = k-1.
- Then start a loop from k...array.size and remove absolut difference for i from sum, and absolute difference for j+1.
- Set new i and j.
- Define new minmum sum and new i_min and j_min.
- Return slice from i_min til j_min inclusive.
