**Ruby: DFS Backtracking and a global sum.**

- Create a method that call DFS, one of the DFS arguments is a path_sum.  
- The `path_sum` is an array, at the begining of each DFS call an element pushed, at the end poped. Only call on `nil` are exception, there is nothing to push. 
- If the node is leaf add path_sum to the global sum.

Let's try.

Ruby code:

  return if x.nil?
  path_sum.push(x.val.to_s)
  if is_leaf(x)
