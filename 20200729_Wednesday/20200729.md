- https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-outermost-parentheses/discuss/762302/Ruby-solution%3A-counter-variable-and-array-of-primitives.

First of all created counter variable that increased by on on open bracket, and decreased by one on closed bracket.

Condition of first primitive character: when counter is one, and character is open bracket. After counter calculation.
Condition of last character in primitive: when counter is zero. After counter calculation in iteration.

- Create array of primitive using first/last character conditions.
- Reduce size of primitives in array, but moving it's borders by one character in both sides.
- Transform primitive array into string by join, and return it.

def remove_outer_parentheses(s)
    a, x = [], s.chars
    start, finish, counter = 0,0,0
    x.each_with_index do |v,i|
        counter += 1 if ?( == v
        counter -= 1 if ?) == v
        start = i if 1 == counter && ?( == v
        if 0 == counter
            finish = i
            a.push(x[start..finish]) 
        end
    end
    a.map{|x| x[1..-2].join }.join
end
```

From this algorithm quite easy to create optimization: write in answer string all symbols except beginning and end of a primitive.
