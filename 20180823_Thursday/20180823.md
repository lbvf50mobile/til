## DSU data structure and DFS algorithm swapLexOrder

https://app.codesignal.com/interview-practice/task/5vXzdE9yzjsoMZ9sk/comments

I solved [this task](https://app.codesignal.com/interview-practice/task/5vXzdE9yzjsoMZ9sk/comments) for 3 days. And here I want to share hints how to solve it.

1) Make a graph by **Adjacency List** structure. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list). Vertex is  an index, edge is swap.  Here fist time `HASH` appears. Key - `vertex`, value array of `vertexes` that have  `edges` with this `vertex`.

2) Find **Connected componetns** with **Depts-first-search**
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_component_(graph_theory)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search
Here is code example of find connected components search using `DFS`: http://e-maxx.ru/algo/connected_components


3) When you have this array with components sort  them in ascending order (small first). The chars able to travel within this each array of indexes. 

4) Sort chars belong to each component in descending order, and put it into the string.

5) DONE

P.S. 
I tried to solve this with `DSU` algorighm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure

But it's a little bit wrong. 
- `DSU` marks each vertex of a grap by index of set. now you able to check if tow vertex belongs to the same set  in `O(1)` time.
- `DSU`structure filled during `DFS` algorighm.
We do not need `DSU` structure for this task,  because we do not need mark vertex, we need array of vertex in connected component.
