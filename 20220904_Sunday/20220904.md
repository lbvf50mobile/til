**Ruby: BFS, Hash, Sort.**

First BFS with row and column. Save values in hash where key is column value is an array with row value paris. Sort keys of the hash, iterate over them push array values into the answer array. Sort pairs in the answer array. Convert rows in answer array from arrays of pairs to array of integets.

Fixed errors:

- Use map without saving changes. Need to use `map!` to save changes in place. Fixed.
