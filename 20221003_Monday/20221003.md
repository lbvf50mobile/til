**Ruby/Go: Select minimum frome the streak of the same color.**

Iterate over all elements, when previous not equal to current one add minumum time to the answer. Soluton is to select minumum value of streak of the same color.

Ok. Let's try. Counter and minimum. When current != previos and just after the loop.

Ruby code:
