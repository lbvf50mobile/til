**Ruby/Go: Do not burst the max one.**

Fill sum and max variables. When previous not equal to current add difference between sum and max to the unswer. O(n). Somehow Ruby has TLE. But there is no way to make it shorter.

P.S. There is a way. But it is not significant, because only several add and compare operations reducued. The same O(n).

  answer = 0
  (1...needed_time.size).each do |i|
    if colors[i] == colors[i-1]
      sum += needed_time[i]
      max = needed_time[i] if needed_time[i] > max
    else
      answer += (sum - max)
      sum = needed_time[i]
      max = needed_time[i]
