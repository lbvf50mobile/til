**Ruby/Go: Do not burst the max one.**

Fill sum and max variables. When previous not equal to current add difference between sum and max to the unswer. O(n). Somehow Ruby has TLE. But there is no way to make it shorter.

**Ruby/Go: Select minimum frome the streak of the same color.**

Iterate over all elements, when previous not equal to current one add minumum time to the answer. Soluton is to select minumum value of streak of the same color.

In code it is implented by one additional variable minumum. When current not equal to the previous just add the minumum to the answer. To make code easy start loop from the index one and set minimum as a ... Wait! Also need a counter. Need to increase index only if counter is bigger then one.

Ok. Let's try. Counter and minimum. When current != previos and just after the loop.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-time-to-make-rope-colorful/
# @param {String} colors
# @param {Integer[]} needed_time
# @return {Integer}
def min_cost(colors, needed_time)
  counter = 1
  sum = needed_time[0]
  max  = needed_time[0]
  answer = 0
  (1...needed_time.size).each do |i|
    if colors[i] == colors[i-1]
      sum += needed_time[i]
      max = needed_time[i] if needed_time[i] > max
    else
      answer += (sum - max)
      sum = needed_time[i]
      max = needed_time[i]
    end
  end
  answer += (sum - max)
  return answer
end
```
