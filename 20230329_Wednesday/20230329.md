# Leetcode: 1402. Reducing Dishes.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/reducing-dishes/discuss/3356880/Ruby%3A-Sort-curr-is-previous-plus-prefix-sum-value.

**Ruby: Sort, curr is previous plus prefix sum value.**

If write down a sum of elements of a descending sorted sub array it would be obvious that adding new element would be equal to value of previous plus prefix sum.

```
x y z
x
x + (x+y)
(x+(x+y)) + (x+y+z)

row: x y z
for x: x
for y: {prev: x, prefix_sum: x + y} => x + x + y;
for z: {prev: x+x+y, prefix_sum: x + y + z} => x + x + y + x + y + z;
```
