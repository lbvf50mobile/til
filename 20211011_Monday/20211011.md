**Ruby: Recursive function returns deepest path to a leaf.**

Set of recursive calls, each function return deapest path to it's leaf and tries to set `@max` the path between it's left and right deepest leafs.
Let's try.

Ruby code:

  return 0 if node.nil?
  left, right = rec(node.left), rec(node.right)
  deepest = left
  deepest = right if right > left
  local_max = left + right
  @max = local_max if @max < local_max
  return deepest + 1 # 1 for the current node.
end
```
