**Ruby: Just recursive DFS.**


This solution is simple recursion DFS, but with one editional parameter `max`, the maxumum node value that had been meet yet, if this `max` value is greater then current value the node is definately not good. The answer stored in the object variable in Ruby terms. Also this `max` value could be `nil` if it is `nil` a node is good one too, this is only for `root` case, but wait! Why should we make our code more complicated? Just halde root manualy and call subsequent nodes by `max` value from the root. Left and right nodes will be called from the main method. Let's try to make the code for this task.
