In this snipped of code, just function pointer emulated, storing the context "node and line", when moving to the left brach store information that left branch is visited for a current node.  In other words here implemented functions call by a stack data structure.

Ruby code:

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :left, :right
#     def initialize(val = 0, left = nil, right = nil)
#         @val = val
#         @left = left
#         @right = right
#     end
# end
# @param {TreeNode} root
# @return {Integer[]}
def inorder_traversal(root)
    @answer = []
    q = []
    q.push([root,0]) if root
    while  ! q.empty?
        a,point = q.pop
        if point <= 0
            if a.left
                q.push([a,1])
                q.push([a.left,0])
                next
            end
        end
        if point <= 1
            @answer.push(a.val)
            q.push([a.right,0]) if a.right
        end
    end
    @answer
end
```

And the classical solution where stack with nodes is used.
