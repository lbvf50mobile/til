**Ruby: Two solutions. By list. By array.**

Solution by list.

Find left, right, pre_left, after right, rotate pointers from left to right. Set left pointer to after right. 
Now important part if pre left is `nil` need to change `head` to right. If not just point `pre_left` to `right`.

def reverse_between(head, left, right)
  # Obvious need have 4 variables. To store pointers.
  prev_left = nil # An element before left.
  after_right = nil # An element after right.
  l,r = nil, nil # These are left and right itself.
  # Find positions of the variables.
  counter = 1 # Counter start from 1.
  prev = nil
  tmp = head
  while tmp
    if counter == left
      prev_left = prev
      l = tmp
    end
    if counter == right
      r = tmp
      after_right = r.next
    end
    prev = tmp
    tmp = tmp.next
    counter += 1
  end
  reverse(l,r)
  l.next = after_right
  # Some times Head of a List chagnes.
  if prev_left # Left is not a head.
    prev_left.next = r 
  else
    head = r
  end
  return head
end

def reverse(l,r)
  prev = nil
  nxt = nil
  tmp = l
  while tmp
    nxt = tmp.next # Save next pointer.
    tmp.next = prev # Rotate a pointer.
    prev = tmp # Save prev for next iteration.
    tmp = nxt # Prepare tmp for next iteration.
    break if prev == r # Stop working with r. Time to quit.
  end
end
```

Solution by array.

Write list to array. Nil all poiinters. Split array in three parts before left, from left to right, from right to end. Rerevse middle. Add all parts together. Redirect pointers. Return first element of the array. Important to make correctio because in array elementa a 0-indexed, but in the task nodes are 1-indexed.

Let's try.
