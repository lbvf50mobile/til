Relative ranks are 1 based indices of descending (reverse) sorted scores. The algorithm is

![Description of LC506 score, reverse sorted score, hash, and mapping.](lc506.png)

- Acquire reverse sorted nums array.
- Generate hash where keys are elements of reverse sorted array, values are 1 based indices converted to string.
- Map original array, substituting elements by values from the hash. 
- Substitute "1", "2" and "3" with a "Gold", "Silver", "Bronze" respectively.
