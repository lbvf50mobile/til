**Ruby: Two data structures.**

Two data structures are used to solve this problem, left one and right one, in left data structure stores number of distinct letters till current index (including), the right data structure stores how many distinct letters after current index (including). Iterate over all consecutive pairs, and if left value for left pair member is equal for right value for right member increase the good pairs counter.
