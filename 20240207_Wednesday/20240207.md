**Go: Fill a Counter, counter to slice, sort, slice to string.**

1. Create a CounterDataStructure based on map. Calculate number of occurrences
   for each symbol in the input.
2. Convert this counter to slice of pairs {value, number}.
3. Sort this slice by number decreasingly.
4. Convert the slice to a string, repeating each `value` by `number` times.
5. Return that generated string.
