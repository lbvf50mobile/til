- https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/discuss/2304965/Ruby%3A-Using-last-row-to-generate-new-one.

**Ruby: Using last row to generate new one.**

- Generation: `[1]*n` - create an array of ones.
- Filling: `(1..(n-2))` range. And `current[i] = previous[i-1] + previous[i]`.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
