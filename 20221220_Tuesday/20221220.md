**Ruby/Go: After BFS counter must be equal to number of rooms.**

Time: O(n); Memory O(n);

In general rooms with keys is a grash, where rooms are vertexes and keys edges. Create BFS and increase counter one every interation. Eventually number of interations must be equal number of rooms, it means all rooms are visited.
