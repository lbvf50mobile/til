**Ruby: Recognize string by ending. There are 26 types of endings.**

**Important: Do not overide [Kernel.p](https://apidock.com/ruby/Kernel/p) in the Ruby programs. `p "text"` it's an extremely usefull tool for debuging. 

String defined by it last character, each uniq string eding with particular characher stores N unique substring with same ending. Where N is the length of the string. Thus only need to store length of the longest string for a particular ending and there are 26 ending for this problem.

Ruby code:

    len = 1
    h = {}
    (0...ps.size).each do |i|
        if i>0 && (ps[i-1].ord + 1 == ps[i].ord  || (ps[i-1] == ?z && ?a == ps[i]))
            len += 1
        else
            len = 1
        end
        h[ps[i]] ||= 0
        h[ps[i]] = len if len > h[ps[i]]
    end
    h.values.sum
end
```
P.S. I got this Idea for solution from [this article](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-substrings-in-wraparound-string/discuss/747989/C%2B%2B-Dynamic-programming-simple-and-concise) by @suhailakhtar039.
