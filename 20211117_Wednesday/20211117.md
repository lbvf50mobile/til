**Ruby: Push DP.**

It is a classical DP problem. Solved by Push DP, from current position "push" values to reachable positions. There is only one way to reach the start position. And all first row cells could be reached by only one way. So fill the first row with ones and create two loops to fill the rest of the DP array. But filling the first row requires not only filling but pushing and the simplest way is just to pre-set the start position.
