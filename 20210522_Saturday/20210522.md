**Ruby: Two loops, and value-index hash.**

**This reasoning has a mistakes, incorrect working with DP array, need to implement further investigation about this task. I changed code to make it works.**

- Ok let's start reasoning. Let define the sequens by it rightest elemen. And it's going to be k. It is obvious that k would be the righest one. Because array is increasing.
- Moving next. Last three elements of the sequence. From left to right i, j, k and i+j = k and i = k - j. Or more precisely @a[i] = @a[k] - @a[j]. And when we find new k index, the number of elements in this sequens would be @length[j] + 1. And if there is no value in @length[j] yet, it must be @length[j] = 2, then @length[k] would be 3. Ok nice. We can move forward.
- Need to have a loop for k it will always move forward, need a loop for j that would be behind k. And need trick hash value_key where under value keys positions in the aarray stored. That would help easyly find do `i` exists by @value_key[@a[k]-@a[j]]. And `i` must be lefter then `j`. Briliant.
-  So let's make a code, and test it.
