**Ruby: Conditions is a loop.**

One loop iterates over an array, if current element equal to target the value calculated and if this value less than min it is saved, at the end of that loop min is returned. Optimization is retun 0 immediately if index equal to start, because zero is a minimum possible value in this task.
