**Ruby: Array of reminders.**

Idea of this solution is that pair is valud if sum of reminders of this pair divided by 60 without reminder. Of course reminders after dividing by 60. This is the main idea.

Next step in implementation is a bit of algebra `first_reminder + second_reminder = 60` and `first_reminder = 60 - second_reminder`. Solution is to save reminder in a data structure and check an amount of first_reminders during a loop.

Also there is an additional case when reminder is `0` in this case, need to check for `0` not for `60`.

Agorithm is.
In a loop over all elements.

- Calculate a reminder.
- Increase the pairs_counter (it is equal to number of first_reminders or number zeros).
- Save current reminder in the data structure.

Let's try.
