Created an array called pocket where stored amount of each type of coins. When customer pay a coin this coin added to a pocket. Then need to start returning change, extracting coins from pocket. If there are not ways to return change method stops and return false. Change counting implemented as a greedy method that extract maximum possible coins in loop until amount of current change will be zero. If it is impossible to do - false will be returned.
