**Ruby: L<=R and R>=L. With text graphics.**

Ok if there are two intervals A and B. The have interception if two conditions implied at the same time:             
1. A left border is before B right border. This means A is not after B.         
2. B right border is is after A left border. This means B is not before A.        

In other words.          

1. A.left <= B.right  [B (A B]  A)      
2. A.right >= B.left   (A  [B A) B]   
**This checking approach  required from the SQL book of John Viescas.**            
   

Then select maximum left and maximum right, and moving interval pointer for from leftmost interval or move both pointers if ends are the same.
