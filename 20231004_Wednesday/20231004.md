# Leetcode: 706. Design HashMap.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashmap/discuss/4129930/RubyGo%3A-One-huge-array.

**Ruby/Go: One huge array.**

Just create a huge array of 10 power 6 and **one more** elements and save -1 as no value stored
by a key. A key is just an index in this array.

Indices from 0 till 10 power 6 include 10 power 6 plus one more element, and all
these elements must be -1. If in Ruby it could be done during declaraion, in Go
need to use a loop over all elements.
