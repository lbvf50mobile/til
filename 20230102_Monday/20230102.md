**Ruby/Go: Check Regex matching.**

Create two or three regex for capitalized/downcase and uppercase strings. And concatinate matching of these regexs with logical or.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 520. Detect Capital.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-capital/
# = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
# Accepted.
# Thanks God, Jesus Christ!
# = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

# @param {String} word
# @return {Boolean}
def detect_capital_use(word)
  /^[a-z]+$/ === word || /^[A-Z]+$/ === word || /^[A-Z][a-z]+$/ === word
end
```
