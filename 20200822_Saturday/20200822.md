- https://leetcode.com/problems/distance-between-bus-stops/discuss/805917/Ruby-solution%3A-prefix-array-to-calculate-clockwise-distance.

To solve this task. 

- Calculate total path of a ring.
- Create array where index stores distance from index 0 to i when moving clockwise. It's called prefix array.
- Sort start and destination pair such as start index is less then or equal destination.
- Clockwise distance is subtraction `prfx[destatnation]` from `prfx[start]`.
- Counterclockwise is difference between total path and clockwise path. Need to return minimum from clockwise and counterclockwise.
