**Ruby: split, map, sort, map, join.**

Convert a string to an array by splitting by spaces, convert each element of an array in number-string pair. The number element created by subsituting all not digits by the empty string and converting to int, the string element of the pair created by substituting all digits by an empty string. Then sort by first element of a pair and convert pairs to it's string element. Resulting array of string jointed into one solit string by spaces. That's it.
