**Ruby: Two Arrays and Hash Map.**

1. Save input list into the Array.
2. Create an Hash Map where key is node and value is an array index.
3. Create an Array of new nodes with the same values by indices. 
4. Set `random` pointers based on the Hash Map.
5. Set `next` pointer by the order in the Array.

Let's try.
