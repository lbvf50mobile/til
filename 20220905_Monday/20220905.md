**Ruby: Two dimensional array. If array size equal to level, push new empty array.**

This task solved by BFS. In the Queue there are node-level pair as an element. On each iteration push value into the answer array. Answer array has two dimensions first one levels, second one values. If answer array size equal to level push new empty array into the answer array.

Let's try.
