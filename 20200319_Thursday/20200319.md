In this algorithm needs to calculate sub tree sum and subtree difference simultaneously. If calculating subtree sum is a classical recursive task, for calculating subtree difference additional data structure used. If it is a straightforward solution it could be a stack, and after DFS traversal of a tree need to sum values of the stack. Further in optimization stack could be substituted by a single variable.
