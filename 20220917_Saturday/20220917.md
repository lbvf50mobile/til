**Ruby: Hash Map of reversed words.**

This solution based on the [RyanGrayson's soltuion](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-pairs/discuss/2585442/Intuitive-Python3-or-HashMap-or-95-Time-and-Space-or-O(N*W2)).

1. Create hash-map backward and array res.
2. Fill the backward with reversed words as a key and indices as a value.
3. Iterate over all words with index.
4. Push a pair in res if there is a current word in reversed.
5. Push a pair in res if current word is a palindrome and there is an empty word in the array.
6. Most complicated part if there is a part of palindorme it the other word. Here word splited in the tail and head, and checked if head in backwards and tail is palindrove iteslf. Or tail in backwards and head is a palindrome itself.
7. Return the res.

P.S. Implemented in Ruby this algorithem is not Accepted and return TLE. But in the Python it words for 4 seconds. That is quite long.  But it is accepted and even faster than 84% of implementations.

      v1, v2 = [i,b[""]] , [b[""],i]
      r.push(v1)
      r.push(v2)
      puts "2. push #{v1.inspect}, #{v2.inspect}." if @d

    (0...w.size).each do |j|
      tail = w[j..-1]
      head = w[0...j]
      next if tail.empty? || head.empty?
      if b[tail] && head == head.reverse
        puts "3. head=#{head} tail=#{tail}" if @d
        v =  [b[tail],i]

Thank you for your solution. It is a real craft of using [Python slice syntax](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slicing). I draw arrays in a copy book to figure out how it works. Than made a [Ruby translation](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-pairs/discuss/2588917/Ruby%3A-Hash-Map-of-reversed-words.) of your algorithm and explain to myself that during the internal loop you divide string in head and tail. And if there is a head in the backwards tail must be a palindrome, and if a tail is in the backwards head must be a palindrome.
