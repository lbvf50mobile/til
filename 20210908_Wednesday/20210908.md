**Ruby: Reversed prefix sum array and modulo operation.**

Ok. Let start reasoning.

First need to get an array where stored number of shifts for each elements to implement shifting ones per elemet. And let's look at the example, moving from back, last number in the `shifts` array show how many shifts will be at all array. Next element toward to begining show how many times will shifsted elements from it till begining.

- Last element 9 times.
- Penultimante element 9 times + 5 times.
- First element 9 times + 5 times + 3 times.

It is for `s = "abs", and  shifts = [3,5,9]` - need to implement just prefix sum array for revresed array or suffix sum array. Ok this is clear. `O(n)` for creating this array.

Next.

Need to create a shifting method. Lets pretend there are only 2 symbols in the alpabet.

- 0 shift 0.
- 0 shift 1 will be 1.
- 0 shift 2 will be 0.
- 0 shift 3 will be 1.

Need to use modulo operation. `(0 + shift_times)%2` lest test this formula.

- (0+0)%2 => 0;
- (0+1)%2 => 1%2 => 1;
- (0+2)%2 => 2%2 => 0;
- (0+3)%3 => 3%2 => 1;

It works. So number of symbols in aplphabet is 26, because thay are lowcase English letters. Index of `a` woul be `0`, index of `z` would be `25`. Need to converst string to array of indices `x.ord - ?a.ord`, then add updated shifts with modulo opearation and finaly convert to characters and to string again. Also I think, it is possible to use modulo oparation when geenrate revesed prefix sum array. Let's try.
