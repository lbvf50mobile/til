**Ruby: Pop as soon as possible.**

All pushed element are unique, that means that only once there would be an item at the top of the stack. And in that moment need to pop it. To implement this algorithm two loops are needed, first one push elements from `pushed`, second one pops as soon as stack is not empty and stacks top equal to current element at the `popped`. True if all elements in popped are marked. Or if `popped` is empty if get rid of popped element.
