**Ruby: Method for delete node with two arguments.**

To delete a node from a one pointer list need to have previous node and a current one. If it is a head previous node would be `nil`, also need to reset the `head`. This means need to have two loops first delete all nodes at the begninig and rearange the head, then, at the second loop delete all nodes in the middle and at the end.  

Method for deleting a node would get two arguments and return next node after deleting.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 203. Remove Linked List Elements.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :next
#     def initialize(val = 0, _next = nil)
#         @val = val
#         @next = _next
#     end
# end
# @param {ListNode} head
# @param {Integer} val
# @return {ListNode}
def remove_elements(head, val)
    
end
```
