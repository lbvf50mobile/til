- https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/discuss/1666792/Ruby%3A-Modulo-invert-shift-add-next.

**Ruby: Modulo, invert, shift, add, next.**

Idea is to get a bit from an input, inverse it, and put it to an answer. Putting into the answer implemented by shift left and addition. Also, a corner case of 0 input is 1 answer.

- Create a loop while input is not equal to zero.
- First get a bit from an input.
- Invert this bit.
- Shift the bit value left by the bit position. It if is 0 bit shift 0, fit position is 2 shift 2 (`1<<2 == 4`).
- Add shifted value to answer.
- Increase bit position number for the next iteration, shift input right.
- Return the answer.
