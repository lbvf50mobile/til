**Ruby: Backtracking solution.**

Create a two dimensional array to fill with symbols for digis. And DFS for a
backtracking, Dfs method gets digit position, and starts a loop for all symbols
for this digit. In a loop iteration add symbol to a string, call next dfs, remove
symbol from string.

If at DFS i is out of range, save this string into the answer.
