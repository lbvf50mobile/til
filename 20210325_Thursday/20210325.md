**Ruby: Array of pointers.**

This is a robust and simple solution. Just save pointers to all nodes in the array, and then just swap the values. And here even no need to fill first index of an array by nil, because this would no make arithmetic easy, because size of array would change. So indices would be: k from beginning k-1, and k from end size - k which could be addressed jusk like -k.
