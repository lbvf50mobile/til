**Ruby: Two loops and recusion.**

Base of this solution would be a recursive function that accepts row and column as arguments, pointer at the word, filled cells. Global variable stores does the answer found if yes functions immediately return. At the begining of the recursive function there are a bunch of checks: bounds, matching pointer and current cell, and so on. Lattthen function mark a cell, call itself for surrounded cells, at the unmark visited cell.

The recursive function is called by a nested loop that inerate over all cells of a matrix. Let's try to make the code.


Ruby code:
