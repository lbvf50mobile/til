# Leetcode: 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.


Grow while no repeats. Shrink while repeats.  
How to detect repeats?  
It possbile to do with a set.   
Is there a delete from set tool?  

No, set is to heavy, better to use bit mask. A character arrives, move pointer left to create a bit for this char. If chchar already set byte and return one. There is a duplicate. If zero there no duplicates and it is possible to move forward. 

What do I need.
1. A Method to convert chart into power of two.
2. A Method to check is there a duplicate.
3. A Method to set char used.
4. A Mathod to delete a char from the bit mask.

Ok I think this would be enough.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
# @param {String} s
# @return {Integer}
def length_of_longest_substring(s)
  return 0 if s.empty?
  @mask = 0
  @ones = 2**30 - 1
  i,j = 0,0
  bit = get_power_of_two(s[0])
  add_char(s)
  size = 1
  max_size = 1
  while i < s.size && j < s.size
  end
  max_size
end

def get_power_of_two(char)
  return 0 if ! /[a-z]/ === char
  2**(char.ord - ?a.ord)
end

def has_duplicates(bit)
  0 != (@mask & bit)
end

def add_char(bit)
  @mask |= bit
end

def reset_char(bit)
  x = @ones ^ bit
  @mask &= x
end

```
