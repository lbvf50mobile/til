**Ruby/Go: Two algorithms. One in Ruby, one in Go.**

In Ruby save elements in two variables, redirect pointer from one variable to another.  
In Go save all list in the slice, redirect from one "index" to another "index".

In both algorithms use special case when need to remove head. Return second element of a list as a head.
