**Ruby: Bit manipulation, lambda for each header byte and tail bytes.**


Here I add some selfmade terminology:

- **Header byte** - a byte in sequence that shows number of bytes in sequence.
- **Tail byte** - a byte in the sequnce after the header byte. If sequence size is 4, there one header byte and 3 tail ones, If sequence is 2 there is one header and one tail.

Each byte sequence has it's header bytes and tail bytes. For one byte long sequence there are no any tail bytes, but for the rest tail bytes are the same. Create a lambda check for each kind of bytes by byte and after conjunctions with mask testing byte must be equal to header bits.

Then, main loop must always point on a header byte. If byte is not from four types of head bytes return false. If the head byte has tail bytes need to check that tail bytes are available.
