To split sequence of three equal parts elements sum of this sequence must be divisible by three. This is a first condition. Next need to do define third and two thirds and create array prefix sum, an array where each element equal to sum all previous elements inclusive current one. And in this prefix sum array find element equal to third and two thirds. Index of third must be less than index of two thirds and two thirds index must not be right utmost.

## Some tests.

```Ruby
def mutateTheArray(n, a)
    prv = 0
    (0...a.size).each do |i|
        tmp = a[i]
        nxt = i < (a.size-1) ? a[i+1] : 0
        a[i] = a[i] + nxt + prv
        prv = tmp
    end
    a
end
```

```Ruby
def countTinyPairs(a, b, k)
    a.zip(b.reverse).reduce(0){ |acc,(i,j)| 
        acc +=1 if "#{i}#{j}".to_i < k
        acc
    }
end
```

```Ruby
def meanGroups(a)
  a.map.with_index{|x,i| [x.sum/x.size.to_f,i]}
  .group_by{ |(v,i)| v }.values.map{|x| x.map(&:last).sort }.sort_by(&:first)
end

```

```Ruby
def hashMap(queryType, query)
    diff,sum = 0, 0
    total = 0
    hsh = {}
    action = {
        'insert' => ->x{ i,v = x; hsh[i-diff] = v-sum},
        'get' => ->x{ v = hsh[x[0]-diff] + sum ; total += v },
        'addToKey' => ->x{ diff += x[0]},
        'addToValue' => ->x{ sum += x[0]},
    }
    queryType.each_with_index do |q,i|
        action[q][query[i]]
    end
    total
end
```
