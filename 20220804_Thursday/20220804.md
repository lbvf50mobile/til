**Ruby: never give a name p to vars in Ruby, it is a kernel method.**

This solution is based on [the nitin23rathod solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/mirror-reflection/discuss/2376191/C%2B%2B-Java-Python-or-Faster-then-100-or-Full-explanations-or).


Second. Never use `p` variable names in Ruby it is a convinient way for logging: [Kernel#p](https://apidock.com/ruby/Kernel/p).
