**Ruby: Array of pointers and two fake elements at the top and at the end.**

Need to make program as simple as possible, there are many corner cases. To aviod them: just copy all pointers into an a
array, push and unshift two fake elements. Set pointers, swap, remove pointers, return element at index 1.

Simple, robust, and no additinoal conditions for different `k`.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
