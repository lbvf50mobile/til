First and foremost, the start and target strings must contain the same number
of each type of symbol. The 'L' and 'R' symbols must appear in the same order
in both strings. Additionally, for the 'L' symbols in the start string, they
must be able to reach the corresponding 'L' symbols in the target string when
moving left, meaning they must be positioned to the right of their target 'L'
symbols. Similarly, the 'R' symbols in the start string must be able to reach
the corresponding 'R' symbols in the target string, meaning they must be
positioned to the left of their target 'R' symbols.

The solution involves the following steps:

- Check if the counts of each symbol (`L`, `R`, `_`) are the same in both the start
  and target strings.
- Write a method that skips over any underscores until the next L or R is
  encountered.
- Start a loop that checks if the next character in both strings is the same
  and whether the start can reach the target. Use pointers to traverse each
  string. If the characters do not match or if the start cannot reach the
  target, return false.
- When the loop is finished, return true if both pointers have reached the end
  of their respective strings.
