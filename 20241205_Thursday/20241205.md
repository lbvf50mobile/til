First thing first in start and target must be the same number of eah type
of sybols. 'L' and 'R' symbols must be in the same order. Third at the start L
must be able to reach L in the target, when it moves left, thus it must be
righter. And R at the star must be able to reach R at the target, so it must
be lefter.

The solution is.

1. Check does the amount of each element is the same in both.
2. Write a method that skips underlines till the next L or R.
3. Start a loop that checks that next character is the same, and start could
   reach the target, and move to the next character. This loop operates by a
   pointers to each string. If charas are not the same, or if start could not
   readn the targer - false is returned.
4. When the loop is finished retrun true if both pointers reach the end.

Tests:
```
"_L__R__R_"
"L______RR"
"R_L_"
"__LR"
"_R"
"R_"
"_LL__R__R_"
"L___L___RR"
```
