**Ruby/Go: Mark ones for delete.**

- Ruby solution. Mask of delete chars filled ones, then a new string created and returned.
- Go solution. Mask of delete chars generated on each iteration if amount of chars in new and old string is equal return old string, if amount is different new string generated and new iteration started.
