**Ruby: BFS creates list of arrays.**

Use BFS to create array of layers.
Iterate over each array and set pointer to the next one, last to nil.

Let's try.

Ruby code:

  levels = []
  q = [[root,0]]
  while !q.empty?
    x,l = q.shift
    levels.push([]) if levels.size == l
    levels.last.push(x)
    q.push([x.left,l+1]) if x.left
    q.push([x.right, l+1]) if x.right
  end
  levels.each do |level|
    (0...level.size-1).each do |i|
      level[i].next = level[i+1]
    end
    level.last.next = nil
  end
  root
end
