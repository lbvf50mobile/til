**Ruby: Moving backward unshifting values to arrays, then join.**

Moving backward across the input array's elements, unshifting (prepending) digits to a first sub array of two dimensional array. At the end of each iteration increase the counter that is initiated as zero, at the beginning of each iteration if reminder of division counter by tree is zero unshift (prepend) new empty sub array to dimensional array. When loop is over, first join glue sub arrays into string, then join string by a dot.
