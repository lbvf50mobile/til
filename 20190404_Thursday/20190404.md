# Create Anagram

You are given two strings s and t of the same length, consisting of uppercase English letters. Your task is to find the minimum number of “replacement operations” needed to get some anagram of the string t from the string s. A replacement operation is performed by picking exactly one character from the string s and replacing it by some other character.


# Example

- ```For s = "AABAA" and t = "BBAAA", the output should be
createAnagram(s, t) = 1;```
- ```For s = "OVGHK" and t = "RPGUC", the output should be
createAnagram(s, t) = 4.```

# Explanation of solution

- Need to create `histogram` for **s** and **t** strings, this is
an array that count how many enteries for each character string contains. Because there are 26 characters in English aphabet this `histogram` could be presented as array.
- Need to calculate difference for each character enterence between **s** and **t** string: `(s_histogram[i] - t_histogram[i]).abs`
- Now sum all this 26 difference, and devide it by 2. Need to divide becase if we comapre to strings **A** and **B**, them have next histograms **[1,0]**, **[0,1]**. As you can see difference in one index, lead to 2 charaters changed in histogram. So sum of histogram changes will be 2 times bigger.
