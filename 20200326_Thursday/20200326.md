- Create histogram as a hash. Where key is element, and value is number of matches. loop #1.
- Iterate over histogram keys,  test two variants loop #2.
    - key and key+1.  number of matches key+1 must be greater than 0. And save in max
    - key and key-1.  number of mathces key-1 must be greater than 0. Ans save sum of matches in max.
- return a max.

Two loops, O(n) == O(2N)
