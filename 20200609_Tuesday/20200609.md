Two loops, external loop iterates indices from 0 to height - 3 inclusively, internal loop iterates from 0 to width - 3 inclusively. Thus variables from these to loops pointed each submatrix left upper corner. Need to check 3x3 submatrix to be confirm all rules: equal sums, different numbers, each number between 1 and 9. Need to be careful. This is an amazing task.

P.S.  If Google about Magic Square it will show that each line sum in this kind of Square is 15.
