**Ruby: Store index of a first char's match in the hash, if key exists check new length.**

Store index of a first char's match in the hash, if key exists check new length. Create a loop with a condition. If char already exists as a key in the hash, calculate new substring length and save at as the maximum one, if have to. Otherwise store an index of the first match of that character in an input string. When the loop is over, return value of the maximum variable.
