 This task cold be solved with BFS. Create an array that going to store sub arrays - levels. And by BFS as element use array of two elements node and level.

 ```Ruby
 # 637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree
# https://leetcode.com/problems/average-of-levels-in-binary-tree/
# Runtime: 40 ms, faster than 89.47% of Ruby online submissions for Average of Levels in Binary Tree.
# Memory Usage: 10.1 MB, less than 100.00% of Ruby online submissions for Average of Levels in Binary Tree.
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :left, :right
#     def initialize(val)
#         @val = val
#         @left, @right = nil, nil
#     end
# end

# @param {TreeNode} root
# @return {Float[]}
def average_of_levels(root)
    return [] if root.nil?
    arr = []
    queue = [[root,0]]
    while !queue.empty?
        node, level = queue.shift
        arr[level] ||= []
        arr[level].push(node.val)
        queue.push([node.left,level+1]) if node.left
        queue.push([node.right,level+1]) if node.right
    end
    
    arr.map{|x| x.sum.fdiv(x.size)}
end
 ```
 I added an optimization as a sub-arrays for levels tow-elements arrays used. And at the end of the loop just convert two-element array into division first element by second. This intend to works faster but eventually it shown the same speed.

#     end
# end

# @param {TreeNode} root
# @return {Float[]}
def average_of_levels(root)
    return [] if root.nil?
    arr = []
    queue = [[root,0]]
    while !queue.empty?
        node, level = queue.shift
        arr[level] ||= [0,0]
        arr[level][0] += node.val
        arr[level][1] += 1
        queue.push([node.left,level+1]) if node.left
        queue.push([node.right,level+1]) if node.right
    end
    
    arr.map{|(a,b)| a.fdiv(b)}
end
 ```
