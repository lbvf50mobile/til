- https://leetcode.com/problems/data-stream-as-disjoint-intervals/discuss/3110817/RubyGo%3A-On-each-get-convert-set-to-array.

**Ruby/Go: On each get convert set to array.**


This solution is based on [Yuanzhi's](https://leetcode.com/yuanzhi247012/) post. 

Use set to add values on every reqest comvert set to array, sort this array, convert this array into an array of pairs.
