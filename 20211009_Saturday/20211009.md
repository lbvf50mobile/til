# Leetcode: 212. Word Search II.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/798866e76a28a7ab584157a97288ed6d

1. Need to create hash where group workds by first letter.
2. Iterate over all cells and apply all words that starts from a current cell char.
3. Implement recursive function that get `col, row, pnt, wrd` as arguments to check do it possible to find the rest of the word strting from pointer from the col and row.

Let's try.

It is correct Algorithm but requires to many time.

Ruby code:
```Ruby

# Algorithm implemented correclty from the first try!
# Thanks God!
# = = = = = = =
# @param {Character[][]} board
# @param {String[]} words
# @return {String[]}
# TLE. But I think as like as with Work Search I, it is impossible to pass by the Ruby using Backtracking of each word.
# Instead need to use Trie as in the @workcool example:

# Really appreciate for that article.

          end
        end
        # End Hash Loop.
        hash[c] = new_arr
      end
    end
  end
  return ans
end

def create_alphabet_hash(words)
  ans = {}
  words.each do |wrd|
    ans[wrd[0]] ||= []
    ans[wrd[0]].push(wrd)
  end
  ans
end

def rec(row,col,pnt,w)
  return true if pnt == w.size
  return false if row < 0 || col < 0 || row >= @b.size || col >= @b[0].size
  return false if @b[row][col] != w[pnt]
  @b[row][col] = ?-
  ans = rec(row+1,col,pnt+1,w) || rec(row-1, col, pnt+1,w) || rec(row,col+1,pnt+1,w) || rec(row,col-1,pnt+1,w)

  return ans
