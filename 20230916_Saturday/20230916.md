**Ruby: Binary Search + DFS. Translaion of a touseeb0008's solution.**


It is a translation of the [touseeb0008's solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-minimum-effort/discuss/4049595/Graph-oror-Binary-Search-oror-Medium-greaterEasy-oror-Easy-to-understand-oror-Beginner) with some improvements. Range for binary search and size of the visited matrix is calculated from the height's matrix on every call, insted of using problem's limits.
