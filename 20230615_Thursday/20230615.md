- https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-level-sum-of-a-binary-tree/discuss/3645505/RubyGo%3A-BFS.-Use-new-queue-on-each-layer.

**Ruby/Go: BFS. Use new queue on each layer.**

This task is solved by a BFS where each iteration of the main loop creates a new
queue that filled by tree's nodes of the next level.
