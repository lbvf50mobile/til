**Ruby: Prefix sum array.**


Solution based on prefix sum array, from this kind of array inteval `[i,j]` sum could be caluclated by `a[j] - a[i-1]` formula. To avoid additional logic when working with `i == 0`, 0 element pregended to the array and thus all array elemens moved one element right and formula is `a[j+1] - a[i]`.
