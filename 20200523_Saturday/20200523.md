In the method for checking: Created a hash table where keys are digits that possible to rotate and values a digits after rotation, keys and values are strings. Number converted to a string, than checked do this string contains digits that could not be rotated, than mapped implemented and initial string compared with mapped one. This method checked called on each number during range iterations. Number of time checking method returned true is counted.

It's already third day I could not solve kpalindrome task at the codesignal. Even have no time to pass open tests. Now I created solution based on that  first and last elements of interval must be equal. And if their are equal it's possible to call recursive call on elements inside this interval. I.e. if `i` and `j` are borders and `s[i] == s[j]`, the maximum palindrome in `i..j` range would be i+1..j-1 plus one.

Ruby code:
```Ruby
def kpalindrome(s, k)
    @s = s
    @dp = Array.new(s.size){ Array.new(s.size)}
    max = lps(0,s.size-1)
    k >= s.size - max
end
def lps(i,j)
    return 1 if j == i
    return 0 if j < i
    @dp[i][j] if @dp[i][j]
    if @s[i] == @s[j]
        return @dp[i][j] = lps(i+1,j-1) + 2
    end
    a = lps(i+1,j)
    b = lps(i, j-1)
    return @dp[i][j] = [a,b].max
end
```
