- https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-stones-to-minimize-the-total/discuss/2964605/RubyGo%3A-K-times-pop-and-push-in-Binary-Heap.

**Ruby/Go: K times pop and push in Binary Heap.**

Time: O(KLog(N)); Memory: O(N);

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap

1. Get total sum of piles.
2. Generate heap of piles.
3. `k` times loop.
4. Get biggets pile, take half, push rest into the heap.
5. Return difference between total and taken.
