**Ruby: Save in an array, find a middle index, return the pointer.**

Let's start reasoning.

- `[1,2,3,4,5] return [3,4,5]` amount 5; last index is 4; returning index is 2; `5//2 = 2`.
- `[1,2,3,4,5,6] return [4,5,6]` amount 6; last index is 5; returning index is 3; `6//2=3`.

Formula to get index is `array_size//2`. Where `//` is integer division. In Ruby, integer division is implemented when two operands are integers.

Algorithm: Save pointers into an array. Find middle. Return it. Let's try.
