**Ruby: Save in an array, find a middle index, return the pointer.**

Let's start reasoning.

- `[1,2,3,4,5] return [3,4,5]` amount 5; last index is 4; return index is 2; `5//2 = 2`.
- `[1,2,3,4,5,6] return [4,5,6]` amount 6; last index is 5; return indexs 3; `6//2=3`.

Formula to get index is `array_size//2`. Where `//` is integer division. In Ruby, integer division is implemented when two operands are integers.

Algorithm: Save pointers into an array. Find middle. Return it. Let's try.
 
Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 876. Middle of the Linked List.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :next
#     def initialize(val = 0, _next = nil)
#         @val = val
#         @next = _next
#     end
# end
# @param {ListNode} head
# @return {ListNode}
def middle_node(head)
    
end
```
