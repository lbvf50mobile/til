**Ruby: Number of subarrays started from the current index.**


The number of subarrays started in the current point is equal to one plus the number of subarrays in the next point.

For example if count from index 0.

- `1 2 3` -  1 sub array started in index 0 (value 1).
- `1 2 3 4` - 2 sub arrays started in index 0 (value 1).
- `1 2 3 4 5` - 3 sub arrays started in index 0 (value 1).

Need to calculate a number of subarrays started in each index of the array. And return the sum of these numbers.


Let's try.

Ruby code:

  @n = nums
  @dp = Array.new(nums.size)
  (0...@n.size).reverse_each do |i|
    rec(i)
  end
  @dp.sum
end

def rec(i)
  return @dp[i] if @dp[i]
  if i < @n.size - 2 && @n[i] - @n[i+1] == @n[i+1] - @n[i+2]
    @dp[i] = 1 + rec(i+1)
    return @dp[i]
  end
  @dp[i] = 0
  return @dp[i]
end
