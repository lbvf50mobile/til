Convert string to array of words by splitting on spaces. Create a loop that iterates indexes from 0 till array size minus 3 inclusively, such index range allows to address two last works by `index + 1` and `index + 2`. During this loop add to an answer array each word stored in `index + 2`, if word in `index` equals first and word in `index + 1` equals `second`.

Be aware to rush using Regex because need to write back reference in it to wield with string like this "first second first second third", Regex without back reference would skip second `first` appearance.
