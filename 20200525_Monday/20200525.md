Given an integer n and an array a of length n, your task is to apply the following mutation to a:

Array a mutates into a new array b of length n.
For each i from 0 to n - 1, b[i] = a[i - 1] + a[i] + a[i + 1].
If some element in the sum a[i - 1] + a[i] + a[i + 1] does not exist, it should be set to 0. For example, b[0] should be equal to 0 + a[0] + a[1].

```Ruby
def mutateTheArray(n, a)
    b = a.clone
    (0...a.size).each do |i|
        prev = (i > 0) ? b[i-1] : 0
        nxt = (i < a.size - 1) ? b[i+1] : 0
        a[i] = prev + nxt + a[i]
    end
    a
end
```

You are given two arrays of integers a and b of the same length, and an integer k. We will be iterating through array a from left to right, and simultaneously through array b from right to left, and looking at pairs (x, y), where x is from a and y is from b. Such a pair is called tiny if the concatenation xy is strictly less than k.

Your task is to return the number of tiny pairs that you'll encounter during the simultaneous iteration through a and b.

```Ruby
def countTinyPairs(a, b, k)
    sum = 0;
    i = 0
    j = b.size - 1
    while i < a.size && j >= 0
        frnt = a[i]
        bk = b[j]
        tmp = "#{a[i]}#{b[j]}".to_i
        sum += 1 if tmp < k
        i += 1
        j -=1
    end
    sum

end
```

You are given an array of arrays a. Your task is to group the arrays a[i] by their mean values, so that arrays with equal mean values are in the same group, and arrays with different mean values are in different groups.

Each group should contain a set of indices (i, j, etc), such that the corresponding arrays (a[i], a[j], etc) all have the same mean. Return the set of groups as an array of arrays, where the indices within each group are sorted in ascending order, and the groups are sorted in ascending order of their minimum element.


```
[[-2,4,7,-6,2,-5,3], 
 [-1,0,0,0], 
 [2,2,-6,17,9,-22,30,-16,0,-1,-11,6,0,-4], 
 [3,3,-8,-2,3]]
 ```

 ```Ruby
 def meanGroups(a)
    # Need to have each array with indes
    ind = a.map.with_index{|x,i| [i,x, x.sum/x.size.to_f]}
    # Need to have hash.
    h = ind.group_by{|x| x[2]}
    # Need to have only VALUES.
    unsort = h.values
    # In values get only first element
    unsort = unsort.map{|x| x.map{|y| y[0]}}
    # Neet to make each row sorted itself
    sort = unsort.map{|x| x.sort}
    # and need to make array itself sorted
    sort.sort_by{|x| x[0]}
    
end

 ```


 You've created a new programming language, and now you've decided to add hashmap support to it. Actually you are quite disappointed that in common programming languages it's impossible to add a number to all hashmap keys, or all its values. So you've decided to take matters into your own hands and implement your own hashmap in your new language that has the following operations:

insert x y - insert an object with key x and value y.
get x - return the value of an object with key x.
addToKey x - add x to all keys in map.
addToValue y - add y to all values in map.
To test out your new hashmap, you have a list of queries in the form of two arrays: queryTypes contains the names of the methods to be called (eg: insert, get, etc), and queries contains the arguments for those methods (the x and y values).

Your task is to implement this hashmap, apply the given queries, and to find the sum of all the results for get operations.


```Ruby
def hashMap(queryType, query)

    add_to_value = 0
    add_to_key = 0
    h = {}
    sum = 0

    queries = {
        "insert" => ->(x){ h[x[0] - add_to_key] = x[1]},
        "addToKey" => ->x{ add_to_key += x[0]},
        "addToValue" => ->x{ h.keys.each{|i| h[i] += x[0]}},
        "get" => ->x{ sum += h[x[0] - add_to_key] }

    }

    (0...query.size).each do |i|
        type = queryType[i]
        args = query[i]
        queries[type][args]
    end

    sum

end

```


```Ruby
def hashMap(queryType, query)

    add_to_value = 0
    add_to_key = 0
    h = {}
    sum = 0

    queries = {
        "insert" => ->(x){ h[x[0] - add_to_key] = x[1] - add_to_value},
        "addToKey" => ->x{ add_to_key += x[0]},
        "addToValue" => ->x{ add_to_value += x[0]},
        "get" => ->x{ sum += h[x[0] - add_to_key] + add_to_value }

    }

    (0...query.size).each do |i|
        type = queryType[i]
        args = query[i]
        queries[type][args]
    end

    sum

end
```
