**Ruby: Define team by a middle.**

There are two kinds of team in this task, increasing team and decreasing team. Let's consider increasing team it consists of 3 memeters and their numbers increasing like 1,2,3. Decreasing team is the same but decreasing. Ok. Next. Each team defined by a "leader" a solder in a center, and number of teams leader ouns is number solders with lower numbers in the left of him by number of solders with bigger numbers in the right of him. So to calculate number of increasing teams need to have array that stores number of solders with lower numbers in the left and number with highter numbers in the right. And then iterate over all array and sum multiplication of walues of the same index of both arrays. That's it.
