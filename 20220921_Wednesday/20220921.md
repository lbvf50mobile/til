**Ruby/Go: Support array of sums and total sum during a loop.**

It is very resurese prone to calculate sum of all even elements every time. Itstead need to have pre calculated sum and during every step remove value of current index and add new value. To get this value, the sub sum for current index need to have additional array where stored 0... wait! We do not even need aditional array, we could take element from the `nums`. Briliant. All what required it is a one additional variable and answer array.
