Create array `state` that describes state of every person, amount of people this person is trusted in and amount of people trusted in this person. Iterating over a `trust` array fill the state. When iteration finished find person that trusts nobody and trusted by n-1 people.

To make filling `state` array easy I add one more fake person to start indexing persons from 1. But it leads to test condition when number of persons in town equal to 1. Because Judge in single man town need to have `[0,0]` state. And this is initial state of a fake person. Now I understand tha it's possible to fill fake person by some unconditional values as like as `[-1,-1]`.
