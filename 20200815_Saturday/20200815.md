To calculate next Tribonacci number starting from fourth one need to sum three previous numbers.
Thus if there are three consecutive Tribonacci numbers highest, middle, and lowest on next iteration:

- Highest will be sum of all three numbers.
- Middle become previous value of highest.
- Lowest become Middle.

Initially there are three predefined Thribonacci numbers with indices from 0 to 2 inclusive.
If need to calculate Thribonacci number with index greater or equal to 3, need to implement n-2 iterations fo calculating next highest Tribonacci number as described above. It is very convenient to describe calculation of next Tribonacci number using [Ruby Multiple Assignment](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/syntax/assignment_rdoc.html#label-Multiple+Assignment).
