**Ruby: Count matches. Sort. Move forward.**

Idea is to generate array of pairs (array element, number of matches) sort it descending by number of matches. Then start to move through this array summarising number of matches till this sum vould be greater then half of the input array size.  

Ruby code:

# Accepted.
# Thanks God!
# @param {Integer[]} arr
# @return {Integer}
def min_set_size(arr)
  # First step need to create array of pairs array element and numbers of matches.
  matches = arr.each_with_object(Hash.new){|el,obj| obj[el] ||= 0; obj[el] += 1}.to_a
  # Then sort it descending by number of matches. We even get rid of elements, 
  # only amount of matches required.
    .map(&:last).sort_by{|x| -x}
  # Now move towards the array until sum of elements would be more then half size of input.
  half = arr.size.fdiv(2)
  number, sum = 0,0
  matches.each{|x| 
    number += 1
    sum += x
    return number if sum >= half
  }
  raise "Cannot find answer, there are no elements occured more then half."
end
