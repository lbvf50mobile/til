In this task need to push minimum and maximum value of the input array as close as possible to each other. And only k steps to push each side toward the other one. K steps to increase minimum, and K steps to decrease maximum. If difference between minimum and maximum is less then 2 times K, return zero. Otherwise return difference subtract 2 times K.
