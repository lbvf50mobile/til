# Leetcode: 1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/64de92496a054616b4ba29106cbe44d8

**Ruby: Just a trick. Any palindrome could be cleared in two steps.**

1. Need to read a descriptions carefully.
2. If remove subsecuenses not a continous and consections subarrays, it is possible to remove first `a` then `b`. Two steps.
3. Really appreciate [Admin007](https://leetcode.com/Admin007/) for his [explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-palindromic-subsequences/discuss/490352/Java-Use-the-Trick-%3A-the-input-string-only-consists-of-letters-'a'-and-'b'!!).

  return 0 if s.empty?
  return 1 if s == s.reverse
  return 2
