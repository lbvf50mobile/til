Bash Brace Expansion do not use spaces to make it works.
- `echo a{a, b}c # a{a, b}c`
- `echo a{a,b}c # aac abc`

```Shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
for f in *; do for x in $f/*; do mv $x ${x:0:1}_${x:2} ; done ; done
# does not copy all files:
# cp -R {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}/. all2/
```

# Some tests.

Given an integer n and an array a of length n, your task is to apply the following mutation to a:

Array a mutates into a new array b of length n.
For each i from 0 to n - 1, b[i] = a[i - 1] + a[i] + a[i + 1].
If some element in the sum a[i - 1] + a[i] + a[i + 1] does not exist, it should be set to 0. For example, b[0] should be equal to 0 + a[0] + a[1].
Example

For n = 5 and a = [4, 0, 1, -2, 3], the output should be mutateTheArray(n, a) = [4, 5, -1, 2, 1].

b[0] = 0 + a[0] + a[1] = 0 + 4 + 0 = 4
b[1] = a[0] + a[1] + a[2] = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5
b[2] = a[1] + a[2] + a[3] = 0 + 1 + (-2) = -1
b[3] = a[2] + a[3] + a[4] = 1 + (-2) + 3 = 2
b[4] = a[3] + a[4] + 0 = (-2) + 3 + 0 = 1
So, the resulting array after the mutation will be [4, 5, -1, 2, 1].

```Ruby
def mutateTheArray(n, a)
    prv = 0
    (0...a.size).each do |i|
        nxt = i < (a.size - 1) ? a[i+1] : 0
        tmp = a[i]
        a[i] = a[i] + nxt + prv
        prv = tmp
    end
    a
end

```

You are given an array of integers a. A new array b is generated by rearranging the elements of a in the following way:

b[0] is equal to a[0];
b[1] is equal to the last element of a;
b[2] is equal to a[1];
b[3] is equal to the second-last element of a;
and so on.
Your task is to determine whether the new array b is sorted in strictly ascending order or not.

Example

For a = [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2], the output should be alternatingSort(a) = true.

The new array b will look like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], which is in strictly ascending order, so the answer is true.

For a = [1, 4, 5, 6, 3], the output should be alternatingSort(a) = false.

The new array b will look like [1, 3, 4, 6, 5], which is not in strictly ascending order, so the answer is false

```Ruby
def alternatingSort(a)
    arr = []
    
    (0...a.size).each do |i|
        if(i.even?)
            arr.push(a.shift)
        else
            arr.push(a.pop)
        end
    end
    (1...arr.size).each do |i|
     return false if arr[i-1] >= arr[i]
    end
    true

end

```

You are given an array of arrays a. Your task is to group the arrays a[i] by their mean values, so that arrays with equal mean values are in the same group, and arrays with different mean values are in different groups.

Each group should contain a set of indices (i, j, etc), such that the corresponding arrays (a[i], a[j], etc) all have the same mean. Return the set of groups as an array of arrays, where the indices within each group are sorted in ascending order, and the groups are sorted in ascending order of their minimum element.

Example

For

a = [[3, 3, 4, 2],
     [4, 4],
     [4, 0, 3, 3],
     [2, 3],
     [3, 3, 3]]
the output should be

meanGroups(a) = [[0, 4],
                 [1],
                 [2, 3]]
mean(a[0]) = (3 + 3 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 3;
mean(a[1]) = (4 + 4) / 2 = 4;
mean(a[2]) = (4 + 0 + 3 + 3) / 4 = 2.5;
mean(a[3]) = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5;
mean(a[4]) = (3 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 3.
There are three groups of means: those with mean 2.5, 3, and 4. And they form the following groups:

Arrays with indices 0 and 4 form a group with mean 3;
Array with index 1 forms a group with mean 4;
Arrays with indices 2 and 3 form a group with mean 2.5.
Note that neither

meanGroups(a) = [[0, 4],
                 [2, 3],
                 [1]]
nor

meanGroups(a) = [[0, 4],
                 [1],
                 [3, 2]]
will be considered as a correct answer:

In the first case, the minimal element in the array at index 2 is 1, and it is less then the minimal element in the array at index 1, which is 2.
In the second case, the array at index 2 is not sorted in ascending order.
For

a = [[-5, 2, 3],
     [0, 0],
     [0],
     [-100, 100]]
the output should be

meanGroups(a) = [[0, 1, 2, 3]]
The mean values of all of the arrays are 0, so all of them are in the same group.

```Ruby
def meanGroups(a)

    a.map.with_index{|val,i| [val.sum/val.size.to_f,i]}
    .group_by{|x| x[0]}.values.map{|x| x.map{|v| v[1]}.sort}
    .sort_by{|x| x.first}

end
```

Given an array of positive integers a, your task is to calculate the sum of every possible a[i] ∘ a[j], where a[i] ∘ a[j] is the concatenation of the string representations of a[i] and a[j] respectively.

Example

For a = [10, 2], the output should be concatenationsSum(a) = 1344.

a[0] ∘ a[0] = 10 ∘ 10 = 1010,
a[0] ∘ a[1] = 10 ∘ 2 = 102,
a[1] ∘ a[0] = 2 ∘ 10 = 210,
a[1] ∘ a[1] = 2 ∘ 2 = 22.
So the sum is equal to 1010 + 102 + 210 + 22 = 1344.

For a = [8], the output should be concatenationsSum(a) = 88.

There is only one number in a, and a[0] ∘ a[0] = 8 ∘ 8 = 88, so the answer is 88.
