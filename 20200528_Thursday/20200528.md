- https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/discuss/657211/Ruby-solution.-Two-binary-search-methods.

In general approach. Two Binary search methods. First one seeks for rotate point, such left most index in array where `a[0] > a[mid]`. And when this 
rotate point is found, call two binary searches on left sorted part and right sorted part. There are two corner cases. First one when empty array is passed, second one when the array is not rotated at all, all array is strictly increasing `a[i] < a[i+1]`, that means `a[0] < a[last_index]`. In first corner case return `-1`, in second result is a binary search on all array length.
