Variable `accumulator` is created and on every iteration over the input array  `accumulator` multiplied by two and increased by a current element value, thus accumulator stored current number represented by binary sequence from first to current elements of the array.  Each element of an answer array is comparison with 0 reminder of accumulator divided by 5.
