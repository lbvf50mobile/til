**Ruby: Push DP, explanation in terms of "platforms".**


Idea behind this solution is that any digit is kind of platfrom, and from this platfrom we push number of way we reached it up to the next platform. Last platform stand after the last digit, it is an end. And this platform stores how many ways we could reach it. First digit platfrom we able to reach only by one way so set it number to one. If pfatform's digit is 1 or 2 we able to push number over the next platfor one step forward. If platfrom's digit is 0 we cannot push, there are no character coded as 0, A is 1.
