**Message for https://leetcode.com/mistersky/**

Thank you a lot!
You solution accepted and  it is very fast 100%/100%.
I had tried two solution using MaxHeap with uploaded in Leetcode [algorithm module](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/kanwei/algorithms/Algorithms) and both of them [bring TLE](https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/51b9304f10aa7fd5e3c5c63b5825e7f2). I did not tested yet, but looks like that this MaxHeap from kanwei Algorithms is not created best ways. Because already several solutions that require Heap consume too many resources and lead to TLE or two last positions in ratings. 

Like these ones, both use Kanwei Algorithms and Both are too slow:  
- [Leetcode: 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array.](https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/3c8c0e1ee2aa9e6773b3ba869a6f3668)
- [Leetcode: 1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach.](https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/aa12654de17ea69a2725aa6a1c3d2878)

P.S. And Sort in chain is great too! I do not know why I always sort in separate line before, while used map and reduce in chains as well as other methods as like permutations and slices.

```
 courses.sort_by{|course| course[1]}.each do |course|
    start += course[0]
    heap.add(-course[0])
    while start > course[1]
      start += heap.pop
    end
  end
```

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 630. Course Schedule III.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-iii/
# @param {Integer[][]} courses
# @return {Integer}
# TLE.
def schedule_course(courses)
  # Based on:
  # https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-iii/discuss/953918/Python-Max-Heap-Solution-with-detailed-explanation-and-comments
  crs = courses.sort_by{|x| x[1]}
  h = MaxHeap.new([])
  time = 0
  crs.each do |c|
    time += c[0]
    h.push(c[0])
    time -= h.pop() if(time > c[1])
  end
  h.size
end
```
