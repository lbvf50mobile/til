**Ruby: Using two Counter data structures. Amount in Magazine must be greater or equal.**

Create two Counter data structures one for a note and one for a magazine. Amount of a sybol in the Magazine must be greate or equal then in a note counter. Use array of 26 symbols to create a counter, and index in the array in a zero based order number of a char in the alphabet.

Let's try.

P.S. It is possible to slightly improve speed if check strings sizes in the begining.

Ruby code:

    answer[char.ord - ?a.ord] += 1
