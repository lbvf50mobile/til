Simple recursion solution.

```Ruby

# Runtime: 52 ms, faster than 100.00% of Ruby online submissions for N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal.
# Memory Usage: 10.4 MB, less than 100.00% of Ruby online submissions for N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal.

# Definition for a Node.
# class Node
#     attr_accessor :val, :children
#     def initialize(val)
#         @val = val
#         @children = []
#     end
# end

# @param {Node} root
# @return {List[int]}
def postorder(root)
    @answer = []
    dfs(root)
    @answer
end

def dfs(x)
    return if x.nil?
    x.children.each do |y|
        dfs(y)
    end
    @answer.push(x.val)
end
```
And iterative solution where low level mechanism of functions reified in hight level. Stack saves state for each iteration and thus we can consider each iteration as a function call. And poping from the stack as termination of a function, and pushing in stack as a function call.

def postorder(x)
    # Iterative.
    ans = []
    
    # What will I save as a state?
    # - node
    # - pointer of a child for a next traversal
    stack = [[x,0]]
    
    while ! stack.empty?
        # Get current state.
        state = stack.last
        node = state[0]
        pointer = state[1]
        if node.nil?
            stack.pop
        elsif node.children.size == pointer
            ans.push(node.val)
            stack.pop
        else
            stack.last[1] += 1
            stack.push([node.children[pointer],0])
        end 
    end
    ans
