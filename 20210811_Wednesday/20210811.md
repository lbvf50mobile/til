Could somebody explain me, why does each element from the beginning after absolute sorting needs to have doubled pair, why there could not be some element that dose not has pair?

***
UPD: Now I explained it to myself, array must be divided in two parts and first part must has a pair in the second part. And the **least absolute value** cannot be in the second doubled part, because there no elements equal x/2.

The reflection is quite tricky. And leads to misleading, and idea of splitting array in two equal parts is a little bit obfuscated. 
***

In other words why dose **least absolute value** had to has pair? why it is could not be that this element does not has a pair, but other has?

Solution is clear, but I cannot proof myself that **least absolute value** must have a pair. What if other elements has pairs, but not the first one?
