# Leetcode: 162. Find Peak Element.

Looks like peak element is very simple `a[i-1] < a[i] < a[i+1]`. Let's try to read one more time. But need to pass in `O(log(n))` it is a binary search, here is simple solution in `O(n)`.  

Ruby code:
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 162. Find Peak Element.

# Accepted.
# Thanks God!
# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @return {Integer}
def find_peak_element(nums)
  return 0 if 1 == nums.size
  return 0 if nums[0] > nums[1]
  return nums.size - 1 if nums[nums.size - 1] > nums[nums.size - 2]
  (1...nums.size-1).each do |i|
    return i if nums[i-1] < nums[i] && nums[i] > nums[i+1]
  end
  raise "Can not find the Peak Element."  
end
```
