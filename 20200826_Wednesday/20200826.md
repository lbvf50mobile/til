Why it is possible to bite smallest substring as soon as it becomes balanced?
This happens because all balanced strings have even length, and when subtract small even number from larger even number result always will be even. And if string is balanced after biting of some balanced prefix, result will be even and has equal number of `L` and `R` symbols.

This is how this task been solved. Every time count of `R` and `L` are equal make a cut. And every time a cut is made increase a counter. And also the test as added, last cut must be after the last symbol - the must not be any un balanced tails. All string must be split into balances substrings. This check is not necessary for current inputs, but may be very useful for security reasons.
