**Ruby: Regex and Array.**

This straight forward solution based on regex and array of keys. So when call sum method select with regex applyed to array of keys, and then this keys maped to a values and a values sumarized. No need to use separate array it is possible to use keys method of a hash.

class MapSum

=begin
    Initialize your data structure here.
=end
    def initialize()
      @h = {}
    end


=begin
    :type key: String
    :type val: Integer
    :rtype: Void
=end
    def insert(key, val)
      @h[key] = val
    end


=begin
    :type prefix: String
    :rtype: Integer
=end
    def sum(prefix)
      @h.keys.select{|x| Regexp.new('^'+prefix) === x}.map{|x| @h[x]}.sum
    end


end

# Your MapSum object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MapSum.new()
# obj.insert(key, val)
# param_2 = obj.sum(prefix)
```

Tests:
```
["MapSum", "insert", "sum", "insert", "sum","sum"]
[[], ["apple",3], ["ap"], ["app",2], ["ap"],["z"]]
```
