**Ruby: Increase row/column counter, suffix sum, set cell row/column max.**

Size of ops is very big looks like it took a lot of resources to fill matrix every time. Instead on each operation need to implement one action, and this action will add how many times that curren row and column would be increased. Then moving backwards in each array (one for coluns, one for rows) add previous value to a current one - thus number of increasec for each row and column would be found. Cell value will be equal min from it's row and column. Let's try.
