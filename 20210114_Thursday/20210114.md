Simple task, because big one is not solved.

```Python
def solution(n):
    try:
        x = [0,0,0,0,7,0,0,4]
        return x[n]
    except:
        return 0
```

```JavaScript
    let fourSeven = x => (4 == x && 7) || ( 7 == x && 4)
    let fourSeven = x => (4 == x && 7) || ( 7 == x && 4) || 0
```

```PHP
function solution($n){
  return (7 == $n && 4) || (4 == $n && 7) || 0;
}
```
