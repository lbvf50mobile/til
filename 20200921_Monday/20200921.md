- https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-characters/discuss/857916/Ruby%3A-iterate-over-indices-increase-counter-if-si-1-si-or-reset-to-1.

Task solved in one loop over character's indices started from second one (index 1 in zero based indices). First two variables initiated counter and maximum value, maximum is zero initiated value equal to 1. If inside the loop iteration previous character equal to current one - counter increased, if not - reset to one. At the end of each iteration maximum value selected from current counter and previous maximum value. At the end of the loop maximum value going to be returned.

    prv = 0
    (0...a.size).each do |i|
        tmp = a[i]
        nxt = i < a.size - 1 ? a[i+1] : 0
        a[i] += prv + nxt
        prv = tmp
     
    
    end
