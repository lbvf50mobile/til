**Ruby: DP top-bottom recusive.**


Create a grid text1.size width, text2.size.height. Each element stores maximum lenght of Longest Common Subsequence starting from correspoinding row or collumn. Filled by a recursive function where maximum selected from different combination of moving one step forward for each string.

Ruby code:

  # two pointers one on the text1, second on the text2.
  @dp = Array.new(text1.size).map{ Array.new(text2.size)}

  # Let start recursive function.
  rec(0, 0)

  # And retrun maximum value that sotred at the beging.
