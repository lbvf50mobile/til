**Ruby: Delta left, delta right, maximum sequence.**

First, need to calculate the number of seats from the left.
Then calculate the number of seats from the right.
Now an interval exists between the most left occupied seat and the most right one. Need to find maximum zeros gap in this interval.

Select maximum distance from these three numbers: delta left, delta right, maximum zeros gap.

Ruby code:
