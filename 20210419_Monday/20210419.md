**Ruby: check parity.**

If column is odd, row must be even. If column is even, row must be odd. Column teat even by a order number of a characther in the alphabed, where a is 1, and b is 2. First convert string to array of characters, first element of array convert intoo onrder number, second element of the array convert into integer relative to current digit. Hence there are two integers, first one is column, second one is row. Apply rule from the begining of this paragraph. That's it.
