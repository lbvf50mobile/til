**Ruby: Sort, two pointers, decision, move.**

Sort input array. Light at the beginning, heavy at the end.  
`i` pointer at the beginning of the array, `j` at the end.  
Create a loop white `i <= j` if `i == j` one man left.  

Three possible conditions:

1. `i==j` add boat, `i` right, `j` left.
2. `people[i] + people[j] > limit`, give boat to a big one, `j` left.
3. `people[i] + people[j] <= limit`, two persons in a boat, `i` right, `j` left.

Let's try. 

Ruby code:
