**Ruby/Go: Traveling between three possible states. Pull DP.**

This solution is based on the [Phat Nguyen's solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/discuss/75928/Share-my-DP-solution-(By-State-Machine-Thinking)).

There are three possible states. Each day cold be in one of these states.

![Three state and transaction from one to another.](lc309.png)

- 0. `Empty state`. Nothing to sell do nothign.
- 1. `Full state`. Have something to sell but do nothing. When buy something the day marked as a `Full state`, there no separate `Buy state`.
- 2. `Sell state`. `Sell state` can be only after `Full state` when have something to buy. A `Sell state` can fill only one day.

This solution based on Pull DP where data copied from the previos indices of an array, but the savory of this task is here several arrays.

- `Empty state` could copy from `Empty state` or from `Sell state`. 
- `Full state` could happens only after `Empty state` - the buy day, or just continue `Full state`.
- `Sell state` could copy only from a previous `Full State`.

The arrays store profit during these days. More in comments in the source code.
