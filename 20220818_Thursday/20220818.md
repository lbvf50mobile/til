First. Create a counter data structure by the tally mehtod.   
Second. Get values, sort them descending.  
Third.  Depending on parity calculate number of elements that need to collect.
Fourth. Start Loop whil sum less then number from the step four.

Summary. 
1. Tally.
2. Sorting.
3. Definde number.
4. Iterate over sorted number and save number of iterations in the answer.

Let's try.

P.S. No need to check parity, the size of the array is always even.
