**Ruby: Moving between indices of same parity is free.**

Moving between indices of the same parity is free. It is free to put all coins of even indices on a particular even index, the same for odd indices and a particular odd index. Thus if all coins on grouped at the indices of the same parity it's cost nothing. I not (coins on both types of indices) it costs one. Calculate sum on even indices, calculate sum on odd indices, if one of them zero return zero, else return min from both. Or just min from both.  Because it's cost nothing to group coins on two adjacent cells if coins are placed on both types of parity.
