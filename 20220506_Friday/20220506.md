- # Leetcode: 1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II.

**Ruby: Use stack and counter of duplicates.**

Iterate over input string, push elements into the stack.  
If stack bigger than one, increase duplicates counter if needs to.  
When counter equals to k: make k pops, nil counter, and cout again.
Move to the next iteration.  

At the end return the stack converted to a string.

Let's try.  

Ruby code:

        end
        counter =  (tmp + 1) if tmp > 0
      end
    else
      stack.push c
    end
  end
