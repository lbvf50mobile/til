**Ruby: Sort, Filter, Select, Check.**


It is a DP Top-Bottom apporach.

1. Sort string by lenght descending.
2. Call recursive method on each word. (because of dp it will not duplicate work)
3. In the recursive method. Get all words that one char shorter, select predecesors.
4. Implement several calls on predecessors. And select longest one. 
5. Possible predecessors could be agragated in a Hash map in O(n) at begining of the task.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
