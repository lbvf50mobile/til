**Ruby: Two passes, log and fill.**

Iterate over all cells of matrix and log where mark arrays and collumns to fill by zeros. At the second pass over the matrix set cell to zero if it's row OR column marked for change. To store information about changes use two arrays one to mark rows second to mark collumns.

Ruby code:
