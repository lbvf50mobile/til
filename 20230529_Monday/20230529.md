- https://leetcode.com/problems/design-parking-system/discuss/3576104/RubyGo%3A-Array-of-reducing-numbers.

**Ruby/Go: Array of reducing numbers.**

Capacity of each type is a number in the array. Car type minus one is an index
of the car type. If the number is zero return false, otherwise reduce the number
and return true.
