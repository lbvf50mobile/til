First I tried to create path method by modefiend BFS, but during coding found that I could not create path out of this algorithm. So I changes modified BFS with iteration to recursion DFS. And it's works despite the fact that there are `10**5` nodes, and recurtion works only for `10**3` nodes. Looks like there are no trees in one line. Or maybe it is a typo and there are `10**3` nodes.

Ruby code.

# Definition for a binary tree node.

    # Idea is find path to pe and q.
    # Find intercection. How to find intersection?
    # They would have the same path if move from the top. So it would be the first difference. 
    
    # I'll try to make recursive solution for creating path. Because amount of nodes is 10**5,
    # but it is not a deep of the tree. But. It could be. if tree is a line, nevertheless I'll try.

    i,j = a.size-1, b.size-1
    while i >= 0 && j >= 0 && a[i].val == b[j].val
