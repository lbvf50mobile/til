Straight forward solution is a loop with a control flow operation, in an iteration divide or decrease a number depending on a number parity. And loops goes on until number become a zero. In each iteration zero initiated counter increased by one. Eventually when counter value is returned. Time complexity of this solution is O(LogN).
