Straight forward solution is a loop with a control flow operation, in an iteration divide or decrease a number depending on a number parity. And loops goes on until number become a zero. In each iteration zero initiated counter increased by one. Eventually when counter value is returned. Time complexity of this solution is O(LogN).

P.S. After this solution it becomes obvious that number could be odd maximum 2 times, at the beginning and when it become 1 after dividing. So the solution in geneal is Log2(N) + 1 for even values, and Log((N-1)) + 2 for odd values. Zero for zero and one for one.
