**Ruby: At the end deepness level must be zero.**

Need to have a stack and a deepness level. Each open bracket increases deepness level, each closing bracket decreases.
When close check type, when open push in stack. That's all.

But it could be even concise, no need to have a deepness level, only a stack would be enough.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby

  close_open = { ?) => ?(, ?] => ?[, ?} => ?{ }
  stack = []
  s.chars.each do |x|
    if ?( == x || ?[ == x || ?{ == x
      stack.push x
    else
      return false if stack.empty? || stack.last != close_open[x]
      stack.pop
    end
  end
  stack.empty?
end
```
