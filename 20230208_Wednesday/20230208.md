**Ruby/Go: Two range as two integers.**

There are two reachable index maximum one - possible. And a current one reached from the last step.  The step's counter is increased when loop's indes equal to a current index, current range. And when a current range is exausted it is time to make current equal to possible and increase the step's counter.
