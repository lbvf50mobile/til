Is it possible to reach `n` index. As it is known last index of the array is `n-1` if the size of array is `n`. Here need to check is it possible to reach `n` index.  Iterate over array and mark reached positions. On every position mark farest index reachable from that position. If next reachable index is `n` or bigger then `n` return `true`. If there is not such return in the loop return false.
