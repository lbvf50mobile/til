**Ruby/Go: Just translation of Mzchen's solution.**

It is just a translation of the [Possibly simplest solutin with O(n) time compexity](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/discuss/48230/Possibly-simplest-solution-with-O(n)-time-complexity) published by the [Maozi Chan](https://leetcode.com/mzchen/).
