**Ruby/Go: No need to convert to binary, digits already in binary, just shift and add.**

No need to convert number to binary, data already stored in the binary format. Need shift and add, also it is possible to shift and `bit or` operation.

The code is based on the [Kiranpal Singh's](https://leetcode.com/kiranpalsingh1806/) solution ["C++ | Diagram | Related Problems"](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-consecutive-binary-numbers/discuss/2612407/C%2B%2B-or-Diagram-or-Related-Problems).
