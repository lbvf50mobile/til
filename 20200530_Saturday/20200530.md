In this task need to add path number to the global sum at every leaf of a tree. So the recursive function called that on each call add generate path number by adding digits to it, and when a leaf is reached add complete path number to a total sum. Total sum will be returned.

# Binary trees are already defined with this interface:
# class Tree
#   attr_accessor :value, :left, :right
#   def initialize(val)
#     @value = val
#     @left = nil
#     @right = nil
# end
def digitTreeSum(t)
    @sum = 0
    rec(t,0)
    @sum
end

def rec(t,sum)
    new_sum = sum*10 + t.value
    if t.left.nil? && t.right.nil?
        @sum += new_sum
    end
    rec(t.left, new_sum) if t.left
    rec(t.right, new_sum) if t.right
end
