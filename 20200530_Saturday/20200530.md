Two binary searches. First to select first match in array this search uses not strict condition `target <= mid_value` and with such condition left pointer eventually appears at the first match. Second to select last match here strict condition is used `target < mid_value` with such condition right pointer of binary search eventually stays at the last match.  Return array were first element is call of first function, and the section element is result of call second strict functions. 

P.S. First time this code on Leetcode works slow enough less then 10%, after a while I ran same code and it gave 90+% and next two times 80+%.

In this task need to add path number to the global sum at every leaf of a tree. So the recursive function called that on each call add generate path number by adding digits to it, and when a leaf is reached add complete path number to a total sum. Total sum will be returned.

# Binary trees are already defined with this interface:

#   def initialize(val)
#     @value = val
#     @left = nil
#     @right = nil

    rec(t,0)

end

def rec(t,sum)
    new_sum = sum*10 + t.value
    if t.left.nil? && t.right.nil?
        @sum += new_sum
    end
    rec(t.left, new_sum) if t.left
    rec(t.right, new_sum) if t.right
