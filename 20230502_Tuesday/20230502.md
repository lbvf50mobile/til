# Leetcode: 1822. Sign of the Product of an Array.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/sign-of-the-product-of-an-array/discuss/3478439/rubygo-using-reduce-and-using-one-loop

**Ruby/Go: Using reduce and using one loop.**

Straightforward Ruby solution with `reduce` and three ifs, and optimized Go
solution afterwards where mapping and reducing are placed in one `for` loop.

P.S. And second Golang solution where return 0 if there is a 0 in the input
array. After reading the Leetcode's [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/sign-of-the-product-of-an-array/solution/).
