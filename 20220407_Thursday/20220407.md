**Ruby: Straightforward solution. Just simulate.**

- Sort.
- If more than two elements two pops. Else break.
- Calculate difference, push.

If the array is empty return 0. Othewise return first element. 


Let's try.

Ruby code:

  while stones.size > 1
    stones.sort!
    a,b = stones.pop(2)
    stones.push(b-a) if b - a > 0
  end
  0 == stones.size ? 0 : stones.first
end
```
