**Ruby: Chars, chunk, select, size.**

Convert string to array of symbols, split by chunks that contains only ones and not only ones, select chunk what contains only ones, amount...

Ok. Interesting that I solved problem where treat  contiguous segment of ones as '11' and more ones. And I solved this task incorrectly but it's accepted because contiguous segment is '1'.
