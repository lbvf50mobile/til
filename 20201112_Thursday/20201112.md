**Ruby: Iterate all start indices of sets, check a set is k repeats of m size pattern.**

Need to check do an array has a set, a set is m sequence repeated k times. Thus there are size - m*k possible indexes where a set could be places in an array.  Then iterate over each of these indices, and send them to sub routine. Sub routing has to loops, external loop iterates from 0 to m and through all length of sub patterns, internal nested loop iterates from 1 to k and check that current element repeated k times in the set in appropriate positions. If all elements are in their places during sub routing it returns true, and main loop of the function return true as well. If there is no any return out of the main loop, false would be return there are no any sets in the input.
