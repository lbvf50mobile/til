Yesturday I cretated table where each row is a number or roll and each cell is a number of faces totaly appears.

Roll number | total variants | each Face appears
--- | --- | ---
1 | N^1 | 1
2 | N^2 | N^1
3 | N^3 | N^2

Where N is nuber of faces. Also I started to count when one start to skip the multiply oÑ‚ N each time the row reach the number in rollMax for appropriate column. Different versions of this programm did not pass test, and I have to come back to this task. Using the FAST method from https://www.byte-by-byte.com/blog/
