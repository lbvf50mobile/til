# Leetcode: 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/f2e2449922a86250b7467a1cc7047d0b

**Ruby: Always shoot the right side.**

Sort ballons by the end. This means the right side of a ballon will be before the next ballons or within their area. Thus if shoot at the right side of a ballon we could find do the next ones are burst, just saving the position of the last arrow.

If the next one is not burst, just shoot its right side. That's all.
