# Leetcode: 1356. Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-integers-by-the-number-of-1-bits/discuss/4227291/RubyGo%3A-Ruby-by-mapping-Golang-by-function-call.

**Ruby/Go: Ruby by mapping, Golang by function call.**

Two types of solutions:
- Ruby. Map an input array to pairs. Sort pairs. Map back.
- Golang. Write function that calculates number of bits on every call of the sort
  function.
