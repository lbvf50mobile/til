- https://leetcode.com/problems/available-captures-for-rook/discuss/749533/Ruby-solution.-Find-a-Rook-Travel-South-North-East-West-till-the-first-filled-cell.

This is a task of 5 loops.

- First loop seeks for a rooks position. And it has internal loop. Iterate over rows, and inside rows over columns. This loop fills coordinate of a rook.
- Second loop. Iterate from rook till the row with greatest value. And stops on first non empty point. If this point is pawn sum will be increased by one.
- Third loop. Travels up till the highest row, and implement the same action. This loops decreasing index of the row.
- Fourth loop. Travels from the cell after the Rook till the right end or first non empty cell increasing columns counter.
- Fifth loop. Travels to the left decreasing columns counter.
