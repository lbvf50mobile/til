- https://leetcode.com/problems/available-captures-for-rook/discuss/749533/Ruby-solution.-Find-a-Rook-Travel-South-North-East-West-till-the-first-filled-cell.

This is a task of 5 loops.

- First loop seeks for a rooks position. And it has internal loop. Iterate over rows, and inside rows over columns. This loop fills coordinate of a rook.
- Second loop. Iterate from rook till the row with greatest value. And stops on first non empty point. If this point is pawn sum will be increased by one.
- Third loop. Travels up till the highest row, and implement the same action. This loops decreasing index of the row.
- Fourth loop. Travels from the cell after the Rook till the right end or first non empty cell increasing columns counter.
- Fifth loop. Travels to the left decreasing columns counter.

##  Leetcode: 1002. Find Common Characters.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/find-common-characters/discuss/749630/Ruby-solution.-Array-to-array-of-histograms-array-of-histograms-to-histogram-histogram-to-array.

Convert array of strings, to array of histograms. Reduce array of histogram to  one histogram, where each key must be in all histograms and have minimum value from these histograms.  It could be achieved by extracting general keys iteratively starting from first element and applying next histogram to it, thus resulting histogram will be updated by current element of histograms array. And eventually transform resulting histogram into the array that consists of histogram keys repeated values times.
