- https://leetcode.com/problems/special-positions-in-a-binary-matrix/discuss/4401011/Go%3A-Use-special-rows-check-at-the-special-column.

**Go: Use special rows check at the special column.**

- Create a map of special rows. Rows with sum equal to 1.

- Calculate sum for each column, if sum is 1, check does this 1 in a special
  row by the map. If it does incease the answer counter.
