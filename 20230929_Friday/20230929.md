# Leetcode: 896. Monotonic Array.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/f1b34d759d5fb1578f87b7eef995e57c

**Ruby/Go: True if up OR down, False if up AND down.**

Ture if all array is increasing or decreasing.
False if some parts of one array is increasing and some parta is decreasing.

First solution is to implement tow checks: for increasing and decreasing and
return logical OR of the results.

Second solutoin is to set two variables increasing and decreasing during the
loop, if both are set return false.
