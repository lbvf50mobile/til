# Leetcode: 896. Monotonic Array.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/monotonic-array/discuss/4106394/RubyGo%3A-True-if-up-OR-down-False-if-up-AND-down.

**Ruby/Go: True if up OR down, False if up AND down.**

Ture if all array is increasing or decreasing.
False if some parts of one array is increasing and some parta is decreasing.

First solution is to implement tow checks: for increasing and decreasing and
return logical OR of the results. This solution requires two loops: one for
increasing check, second for decreasing check. And one comparation as a result.

Second solutoin is to set two variables increasing and decreasing during the
loop, if both are set return false. This solution requires one loop where in
each interation these variables are set after some checks. And logical AND at
the end of the loop and in the loop for optimization purposes (to avoid usless
iterations).
