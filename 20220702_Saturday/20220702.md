**Ruby: Max horizontal stripe by max vertical stripe.**

Firts need to sort all cuts addresses ascending. The size of the stripe is current cut address minus previous cut addres. Both ends are cuts too: begining and the end. Need to calculate maximum size of stripe by vertical cut and maximum size of stripe by gorizontal strype. Multiplication of these sizes would be an answer.
