- https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-bounded-in-circle/discuss/1678594/Ruby%3A-Save-state-after-each-character.-Compare-with-the-start.
 
**Ruby: Save state after each character. Compare with the start.** 

The solution based on the Hint 2.

- Define orientation as a number and an index.
- Create the map for moves based on direction.
- Iterate over all commands.
- Compare state with staring position and orientation.
- Return true if the same point or if orientation is different.

It is obvious if a position is the same, it is a loop already.
If orientation is different, it means at some point orientation would be the same as at the start, and because the sequence is constant the robot would draw a lace ornament within a square.  As the sequence is constant after each pass rotation would be at the same angle. And after the set of passes robot would return at the same point. It would not exit some circle because the length and trajectory are always the same, only rotation of this image changes. 

- `0` North.
- `1` East.
- `2` South.
- `3` West.
