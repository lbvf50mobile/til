- https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-twin-sum-of-a-linked-list/discuss/3535794/RubyGo%3A-Converting-list-into-array.

**Ruby/Go: Converting list into array.**

- Ruby: Just fill array by push, and create loop with variables moving from both
  sidex.
- Go: Absolutley the same algorim, but the optimisation feature is allocating
  array during the compilation time and then use an inted to mesure amount of
  using space.
