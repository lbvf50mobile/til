**Ruby: Recursive DFS without string interpolation, but with concatenation.**

First solutin is recursive. If tree represented like a liest with `10**4` elements it could cause stack overflow. But the solution is simple.

1. Enter method, write number.
2. If there is left. Open bracket.
3. When retur from left. Close bracket.
4. If there is right. Open bracket.
5. When return from right. Close bracket.

Let's try.

Errors.

1. Need to insert empty parenthenes when left is empty. Fixed.
2. Same method called several time, if write `@answer ||= ""` answers from all calls would be accumulated. Fixed.

Summary.

Need to spend more time reading description.
