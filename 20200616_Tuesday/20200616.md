Two iterative depth-first-search save leafs it two arrays. Return comparison of these two arrays. Iterative DFS is like BFS but instead of push/shift used push/pop, and first push ancestor that will be extracted last. If want ot go to the left branch first, left node must be pushed last. That's all.
