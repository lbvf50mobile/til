**Ruby: Hash with positions as values.**

Create hash, where keys are links to the object and values, are positions numbers.

Iterate over a list, check each node does it is stored in a hash, if yes return a value of a hash, if not add to the hash a new key-value pair.

Let's try.

**Note:** Need to return not `pos` in the list, but a link to a node. Even more simply. It is possible to write code without the variable for position tracking.
