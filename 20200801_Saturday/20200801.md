- https://leetcode.com/problems/matrix-cells-in-distance-order/discuss/767339/Ruby-solution%3A-2-loops-sort-and-map.

Algorithm of this solution: 
- Iterate all cells of a matrix in two loops,  first loop is external second is nested.
- During iteration fill array with parks, cell coordinates and distance from input cell.
- Sort array by second element of a pair.
- Map array to leave only cell coordinate as an element of the array.
- Return this array as result.
