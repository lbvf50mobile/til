**Ruby: Pop, add, push, reverse.**

Ok. To solve this task I going to use arrays of integers. Mainly this solution based on stack methods push and pop, taking addend from string converted to integer array could be implemented by pop, adding new numerical place by push going to add places in opposite order, that is why after the ending of the loop needs to revers an array.

Algorithm requires three arrays and one register, register will passes one into the next interation of the loop. Pop, add, push, reverse.

1. Pop two addends.
2. Sum two addends and a register.
3. Push first number place into result array.
4. When loop is finished if there is one in register push this register into the answer  array.
5. Reverse answer array and convert it to string.

That's it. Let's try to code it.  

Ruby code:

def add_strings(num1, num2)
  n1 = num1.to_s.chars.map(&:to_i)
  n2 = num2.to_s.chars.map(&:to_i)
  register = 0
  answer = []
  while (! n1.empty?) || (! n2.empty?)
    a1 = n1.empty? ? 0 : n1.pop
    a2 = n2.empty? ? 0 : n2.pop
    sum = register + a1 + a2
    register = 0
    register = 1 if sum >= 10
    answer.push(sum % 10)
  end
  answer.push(1) if 1 == register
  answer.reverse.map(&:to_s).join
end

```
