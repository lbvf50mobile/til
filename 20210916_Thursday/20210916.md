**Ruby: Move, when cannot move: rotate.**

Create matrix to mark visited cells, start from the top left cornter moving left when step out of the grid make step back and rotate. For this soluting need to create a method that check is postion valid: is inside the matrix and unvisited. Main loop wors while current position is valid, make this position visited and move next. Next step checked in the current interation, if it is not valid spep back and rotate.  Also have a data structure to sotre new direction after a rotation.

- Move Right `rotate >` Move Bottom. 
- Move Bottom `rotate >` Move Left.
- Move Left `rotate >` Move Top.
- Move Top `rotate >` Move Right.
