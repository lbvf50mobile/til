**Ruby: Set index for a number, sort pieces by first element, flatten, check.**


Connect each number from an arr with it's index in the array. Sort sub arrays in pieces by index of the first number of sub array, if there is a number that is not represent in the arr use index out of the arr's indices range. When array of pieces is sorted, flatten it into one dimensional array and compare with arr.
