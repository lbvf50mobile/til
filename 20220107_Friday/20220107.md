**Ruby: Create an array of pointers to a list of nodes.**

It is possible to iterate over the list every time and on each iteration check "do return?" or not, but in this case, there is an extremely small possibility to reach the end. Another way is to create an array of pointers and use `rand` to select a value. 

At the initialization use push to insert pointers into the array. At the getter just use `rand` with `array.size` as an argument.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
