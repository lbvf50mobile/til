# Codesingal: Maximal Square. Leetcode: 1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix.

- https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/151e249e900478cc607ce38f294fd108

Input:
matrix:
```
[["0","1","1","0","1"], 
 ["1","1","0","1","0"], 
 ["0","1","1","1","0"], 
 ["1","1","1","1","0"], 
 ["1","1","1","1","1"], 
 ["0","0","0","0","0"]]
 ```
Output:
9
Expected Output:
9

I suppose that if cell is 1 it's possible to calculate it by `dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i][j+1],dp[i+1][j])`.

def maximalSquare(matrix)
  return 0 if matrix.size.zero?
  @x = matrix
  @h = matrix.size
  @w = matrix[0].size
  @dp = {}
  ans = 0
  (0...@h).each do |i|
    (0...@w).each do |j|
        tmp =  rec(i,j)
        ans = tmp if tmp > ans
    end
  end
  ans * ans
end

def rec(row,col)
    return 0 if col == @w
    return 0 if row == @h
    return 0 if @x[row][col] == ?0
    key = "#{row}:#{col}"
    return @dp[key] if @dp[key]
    @dp[key] = 1 + [rec(row+1,col), rec(row, col+1)].min
end
```

Elements of row except border ones calculated as `a[row-1][col]+a[row-1][col-1]`, border ones are `1`.

Confusing description `lines` means `rows` as in average Pascal's triangle, not a `diagonals` as like as on added picture where each diagonal has it's own color.

#### [Uniq String Characters](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a262cfb8f27f217f700000b).

Using [Generator expressions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/) and set [symmetric difference](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset.symmetric_difference). Created source by concatinating two strings, and pattern by symmetirc difference of sets generated of each string characters. Answer string was generated by selecting characters in order from source that are in teh pattern.
