At the each recursion call find depth of each subtree. And eventually return the maximum depth from two of them. Also during recursion calculate number of edges between deepest leafs of both sub trees. The maximum number of edges between deepest leafs of sub trees will be the answer.

![Show how recursion works](lc543.png)

Example when longest pash does not touch a root. When left subtree have two similar length of left and right branches and sum of this lengths is bigger than sum with right subtree length. 

![Example when subtree has equal left and right part and it's length within subtree is greater than sum with other subtree](lc543example.png)
