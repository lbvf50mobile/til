**Ruby: Sum and subtraction.**

Arithmetic progression sum formula: `n(a1+an)/2` in this case it is `n(1 + n)/2`.  
Let's test  `1+2+3 = 6` and  `3(1+3)/2 = 4*3/2 = 6`. Correct.

To solve this problem calculate Arithmenic progression sum ans substitute the atcual sum of an input array.

Let's try.

Ruby code:
```Ruby

  s - nums.sum
