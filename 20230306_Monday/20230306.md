# Leetcode: 1539. Kth Missing Positive Number.

**Ruby/Go: Check gaps between last and current.**

Use `last` vaiable that last unmissed number, when interate over an array `current-last-1` is an ammount of missed elements. Thus it is possible to increase the counter of missed elements and fugure out `k-th` elmment by `counter` and `last` variables.
