**Ruby: Translation.**

Eventually this code is used.

Really appreciate for this solution.

What is a sub problem?

Let it be the end of a longest polindrom?
No.  Not enought information.

Let it be a center of polidrome?
No how to deal with even lenght palidromes.

Need to look at recursion.
And need to have start and end of the palindrome.
And the address would be two pointers.

Now qestion how to split the all string into palindromes.

Ok. this would be top down approach.

    [[i,i],[i,i+1]].each do |(a,b)|
      while a >= 0 && b < l && s[a] == s[b]
