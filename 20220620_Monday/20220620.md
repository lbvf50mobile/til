**Ruby: Two loops and one set.**

It is a Ruby transltion of the [Leetcode solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/short-encoding-of-words/solution/). All words from the input array stored in the set, then iterate over words in external loop and over a words suffixes in the internal loop. In the internal "suffix" loop delete all suffix mathes from the set. Then return sum of all words lenthes from the set extented by one.
