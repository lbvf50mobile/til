**Ruby: Two select and join. And write with two pointers.**

Select even numbers into a separate array. Select odd numbers into a separate array. Join the arrays.

Let's try.


Ruby code(1):
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 905. Sort Array By Parity.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity/
# = = = = = = =
# Accepted.
# Thanks God!
# = = = = = = =
# Runtime: 149 ms, faster than 33.33% of Ruby online submissions for Sort Array By Parity.
# Memory Usage: 212.2 MB, less than 7.69% of Ruby online submissions for Sort Array By Parity.
# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @return {Integer[]}
def sort_array_by_parity(nums)
  nums.select(&:even?) + nums.select(&:odd?)
end
```

Create two pointers. First points to the begining of the array second to the end of the array. Even number write in first one and move it right, odd number write into the second pointer and move it left. 

Let's try.

Ruby code(2):
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 905. Sort Array By Parity.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity/
# = = = = = = =
# Accepted.
# Thanks God!
# = = = = = = =
# Runtime: 216 ms, faster than 5.13% of Ruby online submissions for Sort Array By Parity.
# Memory Usage: 211.8 MB, less than 46.15% of Ruby online submissions for Sort Array By Parity.
# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @return {Integer[]}
def sort_array_by_parity(nums)
  ans = Array.new(nums.size)
  i,j = 0, nums.size - 1
  nums.each do |x|
    if x.even?
      ans[i] = x; i += 1;
    else
      ans[j] = x; j -= 1;
    end
  end
  ans
end
```

Also it is possible to find first Odd from the left and first Even from the right and swap them. Then repeat the process starting from postions after swaped elements.
