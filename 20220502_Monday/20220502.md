**Ruby: Two select and join. And write with two pointers.**

Select even numbers into a separate array. Select odd numbers into a separate array. Join the arrays.

Let's try.


Ruby code(1):
```Ruby
# Leetcode: 905. Sort Array By Parity.

# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @return {Integer[]}
def sort_array_by_parity(nums)
  nums.select(&:even?) + nums.select(&:odd?)
end
```

Create two pointers. First point on the begining of the array second on the of the array. Even number write in first oneand move it right, odd number write into the second and move it left. 

Let's try.
