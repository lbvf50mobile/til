Create matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns where each element is an empty string. Iterate over input moves and depending of index parity set 'x' or 'o' as a mark to be saved into the matrix. After each move run check method, that returns false if there is no winner, or winner name otherwise. If there is a winner return his name. If the loop is finished and there is no winner return "Draw" if number of moves is less then 9. Otherwise game is not finished no winner not enough moves and return "Pending".

There is a loop inside checking method that create array that comprises row, column and diagonal of a current index. If diagonal index is more than 0 will be returned second diagonal. Each element of this array is a string. And when the array is filled it checked for containing "xxx" or "ooo" strings. When one of these stings exists in the array appropriate name of a winner is returned.
