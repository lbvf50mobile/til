# Leetcode: 228. Summary Ranges.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/summary-ranges/discuss/1807109/Ruby%3A-Insert-when-the-previous-plus-one-is-not-equal-to-the-current-element.

**Ruby: Insert when the previous plus one is not equal to the current element.**

Base principle. Insert into an answer array when `nums[i-1]+1 != nums[i]`.  

The second question is what to insert? An answer is to insert a pair with start and end elements inclusive or a number when start and elements are equal.  

Some cases.  
- If in the pair both elements are equal insert one number.
- Need to insert a pair after the end of the loop.
- Need to generate a pair before the loop.

Additional description.
- If it is time to insert set first and last elements of the pair.
- If it is not a time for an insertion set only the last element of the pair.

In general. 
A loop starts from the second element. And inserting into the answer array on condition.

Let's try.
