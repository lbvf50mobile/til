**Ruby/Go: If Alice has the same amount of moves she loses.**

Number of moves does not depends on the their order. If Alice has the same
amount of moves with Bob she loses. To return true a number of Alice's moves
must be greater than number of Bob's moves.

Solved by one loop from second till penultimate index, and increase counter when
previos, current and next elements are the same.
