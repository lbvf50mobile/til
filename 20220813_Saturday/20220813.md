**Ruby: Check each index, by a counter and word size steps.**

It is a translation of [the solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/solution/).

Iterate over all indicies of a string and check does substring is valid. Check implemented by a Counter Data Structer and slicing with compare.


Errors during coding. Use plus instead of multiply, call push with square brackets, incorrect loop interval for checking incies.
