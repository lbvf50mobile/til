# Leetcode: 886. Possible Bipartition.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/possible-bipartition/discuss/2936700/RubyGo%3A-BFS-with-colors-as-visited.


**Ruby/Go: BFS with colors as visited.**

Instead of general BFS in this solution visited array is array with 3 possible element states.

- Not visteted: 0.
- Visited red: 1.
- Visted bule: 2.

As like as in the connected components interate over all elements ans start BFS on unvisted vertexes. During BFS colorize children in an opposite color. If meet a child with a same color return false.

If during BFS loops there is no false return: return true.
