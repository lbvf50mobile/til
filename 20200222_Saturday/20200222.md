Wow. Considering this is arguably simply a problem to teach about the implementation of boolean comparisons in a class, I'd have to say: way to go overboard. "Figure out how to make a class evaluate to True or False, and while you're at it, try to come up with an algorithm for an NP-complete problem that solves in <4s:"
I spent 2 days solving this (and in the process basically reinventing the wheel mathematicians figured out centuries ago). While it was fun, my epiphany came during the last 2 hours.
For those who don't have 2 days, here's a hint: 100! is infinitely larger than 26! After that sinks in, think about organizing a city tour of Kaliningrad....
