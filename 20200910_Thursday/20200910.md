Lets start reasoning from the simplest case if coordinates of two points are equal - this this case add 0 to seconds.  
Second case both points are on a horizontal line this means that y coordinates are the same, here need to add absolute value of difference x coordinates to time.
Third case is similar to previous one both point on a vertical line, x coordinates are equal, add to a total time absolute value of y coordinates difference.

And the most codding verbose case when need to travel by diagonal first and then by one of axes. General idea is to reach one coordinate by diagonal, get new position of second coordinate, and from this new point reach desirable value for a second coordinate. And total time will be reaching first coordinate by diagonal plus reaching second coordinate by axis.

In this code, implemented checking for reaching second points by coordinates increments. And in verbose case second coordinate has two increments, first when moving by diagonal and second when moving by axe.

I created several versions of code, eventually when made checking for each [possible way](https://gist.github.com/lbvf50mobile/3b80909c6980d5f687a25f231b7d3f0a#file-add_total_possible_checks-rb-L1), and still have error on some hidden test. First move till required x or y by diagonal and then go straight up or down. And my solution works even faster than test. But does not pass them. This is a question for research.
