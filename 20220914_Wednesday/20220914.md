**Ruby: Backtracking, for palindrome only one type could be odd or no odd at all.**

Key to this task is carefull reading last line of the descripion. In general in palindrome could be only one type of sybols could be represened in an odd amount. Or there no odd at all.

The solution is DFS Backtracking, filling Counter datastructure with values, and check there is only one or no at all odd amounts in the Counter in the Leafs.
